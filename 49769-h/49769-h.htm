<h2>TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE:</h2>
<p>
In transcribing this book, the proofreaders found and corrected several
minor typographical errors which did not affect the sense of the text.
In the caption to Figure 541, the equation for the voltage of a Weston cell
at different temperatures was missing a digit "1" and this has been
corrected. There is a reference to a Figure 619 but no such figure exists
in the original text. There are references to a Figure 119 and a Figure 443;
these presumably exist in one of the preceding volumes of the series.

GALVANOMETERS
</h2>
<p>If a compass needle be allowed to come to rest in its natural
position, and a current of electricity be passed through a wire
just over it from north to south, the north seeking end of the
needle will be deflected toward the east. If the wire be placed
under the needle and the current continued from north to south
the needle will be deflected toward the west. Again, if the current
be passed from north to south over the needle, and back
from south to north under the needle, as shown in <a href="#Fig_504">fig. 504</a>, the
magnetic effect will be doubled, and the needle deflected proportionately.
Upon these phenomena depend the working of
galvanometers.

    alt="Fig 503Effect of neighboring current upon a magnetic needle Above the needle and" title="Fig 503Effect of neighboring current upon a magnetic needle Above the needle and"
  />
<p class="caption"><a id="Fig_503"></a><span class="smcap">Fig</span>. 503.--Effect of neighboring current upon a magnetic needle. Above the needle and
parallel to it is a conductor carrying an electric current, the current flowing in the direction
indicated by the arrow. This causes the north pole of the needle to turn toward the east.
If the conductor be held <i>below</i> the needle, its north pole will turn in the opposite direction
or toward the west. These movements are easily determined by Ampere's rule as follows:
<i>If a man could swim in the conductor with the current, and turn to face the needle, then the
north pole of the needle will be deflected toward his left hand</i>.

<b>Ques. Describe a simple galvanometer.</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. It consists essentially of a magnetic needle suspended
within a coil of wire, and free to swing over the face of a graduated
dial.
</p>
<p><b>Ques. What is a galvanoscope and how does it differ
from a galvanometer?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. A galvanoscope, as shown in <a href="#Fig_504">fig. 504</a>, serves merely to
indicate the presence of an electric current without measuring
its strength. It is an indicator of currents where the movement
of the needle shows the direction of the current, and indicates
whether it is a strong or a weak one. When the value of the
readings has been determined by experiment or calculation any

the same conductor is simply carried back <i>beneath</i> the needle and hence both the

vertical section is ineffective. In accordance with Ampere's swimming rule, the <i>upper</i>
wire causes the N pole of the needle to turn to the left, while if a man can imagine himself
swimming in the lower wire in the direction of the current, and facing the needle (that is,
swimming on his back), the N pole of the needle will turn to his left--that is to the east.

<b>Ques. For what use are galvanometers employed?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. They are used for detecting the presence of an electric
current, and for determining its direction and strength.
</p>
<p><b>Ques. How is the direction and strength of the current
indicated?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. When a galvanometer is connected in a circuit, the
direction of the current is indicated by the side towards which
the north pole of the needle moves, and the current strength by
the extent of the needle's deflection.

<p class="caption"><a id="Fig_505"></a><span class="smcap">Fig</span>. 505.--Effect upon a magnetic needle of a neighboring current in a coil. The coil as shown,
is equivalent to several loops, that is, the force tending to deflect the needle is equal to
that of a single loop multiplied by the number of turns. Hence, by using a coil with a
large number of turns, a galvanometer may be made very sensitive so that the needle will
be perceptibly deflected by very feeble currents. An instrument, as shown in the figure
is called a <i>galvanoscope</i>. When it is accurately constructed, and supplied with a scale
showing how many degrees the needle is deflected it is then called a galvanometer.
</p>
</div>
<p><b>Ques. How should a galvanometer be set up before
using?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. When no current is flowing, the coil should be parallel
to the magnetic needle when at rest.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
<b>Ques. What is a "sensitive" galvanometer?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. One which requires a very small current or pressure to
produce a stated deflection.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It does not follow that a galvanometer which is sensitive for current
measurement will also be sensitive for pressure measurement.

</p>
</div>
<p><b>Ques. Define the term "sensibility."</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. With reference to mirror reflecting galvanometers it
may be defined in three ways. First, in <i>megohms</i>, the sensibility
being the number of <i>megohms</i> through which one volt will produce
a deflection of one millimeter with the scale at one meter
distance. Second, in <i>micro-volts</i>, the sensibility being the number
of micro-volts which applied directly to the terminals of the
galvanometer will produce a deflection of one millimeter on a
scale one meter from mirror. The sensibility is best stated in
megohms for high resistance galvanometers and in micro-volts
for low resistance galvanometers, and is frequently given both
for galvanometers for intermediate resistance. Third, in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
micro-amperes, the sensibility being the number of micro-amperes
that will give one millimeter deflection with scale at a
distance of one meter.
</p>
<p><b>Ques. Upon what does the sensibility depend?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. 1, Upon the number of times the current circulates
around the coil, 2, the distance of the needle from the coil, 3,
the weight of the needle, 4, the current strength, and 5, the
amount of friction produced by its movement.

very fine wire, and shunts are generally used in connection with them.
</p>
</blockquote>
<hr class="tb" />
<p>NOTE.--Strong currents must not be passed through very sensitive galvanometers, for
even if they be not ruined, the deflections of the needle will be too large to give accurate measurements.
In such cases the galvanometer is used with a shunt, or coil of wire arranged so
that the greater part of the current will flow through it, and only a small portion through the
galvanometer.

<p><b>Ques. What is the action of short and long coil galvanometers?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. With a given current, the total magnetizing force which
deflects the needle is the same, but with a short coil, it is produced
by a large current circulating around a few turns, instead of a
small current circulating around thousands of turns as in the
long coil. The short coil being of low resistance is used to
measure the current, and the long coil with high resistance, is
suitable for measuring the pressure. Hence, a short coil instrument
with its scale directly graduated in amperes is an <i>ammeter</i>,
and the long coil type with graduation in volts is a <i>voltmeter</i>.

<b>Classes of Galvanometer.</b>--There are numerous kinds of

two classes, as those having:

<ol>
<li>Movable magnet and stationary coil;
</li>
<li>Stationary magnet and movable coil.

in the suspension fibre.
</p>

<b>Astatic Galvanometer.</b>--It has been pointed out how a
compass needle is affected when a wire carrying a current is held
over or under it, the needle being turned in one direction in the
first instance, and in the opposite direction for the second position
of the wire.

<p class="caption"><a id="Fig_511"></a><span class="smcap">Fig</span>. 511.--Connections of single coil astatic needles. The coil surrounds the lower needle
and the direction of the current between the two needles tends to turn them the same way.
</p>
</div>
<p>The earth's magnetism naturally holds the compass needle
north and south. The magnetic field encircling the wire, being
at right angles to the needle (when the wire itself is parallel therewith),
operates to turn it from its normal position, north and
south, so as to set it partially east and west. However, on account
of the fact that the earth's magnetism does exert some force
tending to hold the needle north and south, it is evident that no
matter how strong the current, the latter can never succeed in
turning the needle entirely east and west. The accomplishment
of this is further prevented by the reason of the points of the
needle, where the magnetic effect is greatest, quickly passing out
of the reach of the magnetic field, where it is now practically
operated on only in a slight degree. Thus it would take quite a
powerful current to hold the needle deflected any appreciable
distance. The use of a shorter needle is, therefore, more desirable.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
It is evident in this style of instrument that the effect of the
current cannot be accurately measured, because it acts in opposition
to the earth's magnetism, and as this is constantly varying,
some method must be employed which will either destroy the
earth's magnetism or else neutralize it.
</p>
<p>In the astatic galvanometer, the earth's magnetism is neutralized
by means of <i>astatic needles</i>. These consist of a combination
of two magnetic needles of equal size and strength, connected
rigidly together with their poles pointing in opposite and parallel
directions, as shown in <a href="#Fig_510">fig. 510</a>. As the north pole of the earth
attracts the south pole of one of the needles, it repels with equal
strength the north pole of the other needle, hence, the combination
is independent of the earth's magnetism and will remain at rest
in any position.

be reflected from the mirror to a screen. Resistance, .5 to 1,000 ohms.
</p>
</div>
<p><b>Ques. Upon what does the movement of the needles
depend?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. Upon the combined effect of the magnetic attraction of
the current which tends to deflect the needles, and the torsion

in the suspension fibre which tends to keep the needle at the
zero position.
</p>
<p><b>Ques. Does the astatic galvanometer give correct
readings for different values of the current?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. When the deflections are <i>small</i> (that is, less than 10°
or 15°), they are very nearly proportional to the strength of the
currents that produce them.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus, if a current produce a deflection of 6° it is known to be approximately
three times as strong as a current which only turns the needle
through 2°. But this approximate proportion ceases to be true if the
deflection be more than 15° or 20°.

<p><b>Ques. Why does the instrument not give accurate

the current, since the poles are no longer within the coils, but

the force acting on them, part only of the force is turning them
against the directive force of the fibre; the other part is uselessly
pulling or pushing them along their length.

so arranged that the plug inserted at the terminal marked 50 puts in circuit all the coils;
marked at the terminal 50--all except the 150 ohm coil; and so on, till at the zero terminal
only the copper band is in circuit. Fixed to the needle, which is balanced on jewel and

The coil of this instrument consists of a simple circle of stout
copper wire from ten to fifteen inches in diameter. At the center
is delicately suspended a magnetized steel needle not exceeding
one inch in length, and usually furnished with a light index of
aluminum. When the galvanometer is in use, the plane of the
ring must be vertical and in the magnetic meridian. A horizontal
section through the middle of the instrument is shown in
<a href="#Fig_517">fig. 517</a>. For simplicity, the coil is supposed to have but a single
turn of wire, the circles surrounding the wire representing the
magnetic lines of force. By extending the lines of force until
they reach the needle, it will be seen that with a short needle, the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>

is placed with its coil in the magnetic meridian.

galvanometer this principle is employed in the measurement of currents. A magnetic needle
is pivoted in a field of known strength. The current to be measured is passed round a coil
(or coils) which generates a field at right angles to the original field. The needle then lies
along the direction of the resultant field, and by finding the tangent of its angle of deflection,
and knowing the field strength produced by unit current in the coil, the current strength
can be found.

<p class="caption"><a id="Fig_521"></a><span class="smcap">Fig</span>. 521.--Mechanical explanation of the tangent law. Construct an apparatus as shown in the
figure. The short wooden block, NS, represents the magnetic needle. This piece of wood
turns around its center, C, which may be an ordinary nail. It will now be seen that two
different forces act upon N; namely, the weight, G (one or two ounces), and the changeable
weights which are placed in the scoop, W (made of cardboard). The height of the roll, or
wheel, R, is such that the cord, RN, runs horizontally, when NS stands vertically, i.e., when
there is no weight in the little scoop. If the wheel, R, be placed sufficiently far from NS,
the string RN, will always remain almost horizontal, even if NS be deviated. The thin
hand on NS moves over a vertical scale, which is divided into equal parts, as shown. This
scale may be made of cardboard. If the hand point to division 1 when one ounce is placed
in the scoop, it will point to 2 for two ounces, to 3 for three ounces, etc. At 45° the needle
is deviated at its greatest angle, and this is, therefore, the sensitivity angle of the tangent
galvanometer. The deviating values are, therefore, proportionate to the scale parts 01,
02, and 03, and so on; and, inasmuch as these themselves are tangents, the tangent law
will hold good.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
<b>Ques. How is the tangent galvanometer constructed
to give direct readings?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. To obviate reference to a table, the circular scale of
the instrument is sometimes graduated into tangent values, as
in <a href="#Fig_520">fig. 520</a>, instead of being divided into equal degrees.
</p>

<p class="caption"><a id="Fig_522"></a><span class="smcap">Fig</span>. 522.--Queen tangent and sine galvanometer. This instrument properly adjusted can be
used as a standard instrument for laboratory work. The brass ring is 12 inches in diameter,
and the grooves in which the wire is wound are carefully turned so as to be of true
rectangular cross section, thus allowing the constant of the instrument to be accurately calculated
and compared with the constant as obtained by other methods. The compass box
is 5 inches in diameter and is so held in position that it may be raised or lowered, rotated
on its vertical axis, shifted out of the plane of the coil, etc., thus enabling the operator to
acquire proficiency with the instrument and to meet all cases of derangement possible. The
dial is graduated to single degrees, and the needle is suspended by a very light cocoon fibre.
The whole instrument can be turned about its vertical axis, and a quadrant graduated in
degrees upon the base allows the amount of rotation to be accurately measured, and the
laws of the sine galvanometer investigated. The instrument is wound to measure .25
ampere to 8 amperes.
</p>
</div>
<p><b>Ques. What is the objection to the scale with tangent
values?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. It is more difficult to divide an arc into tangent lines
with accuracy than into equal degrees.
</p>
<p><b>Ques. What disadvantage has the tangent galvanometer?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. The coil being much larger than the needle, and hence
far away from it, reduces the sensitiveness of the instrument.

<b>The Sine Galvanometer.</b>--This type of instrument has a
vertical coil which may be rotated around a vertical axis, so that
it can be made to follow the magnetic needle in its deflections.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the sine galvanometer, the coil is moved so as to follow the needle
until it is parallel with the coil. Under these circumstances, the strength
of the deflecting current is proportional to sine of angle of deflection.

<p class="caption"><a id="Fig_523"></a><span class="smcap">Fig</span>. 523.--Central Scientific Co. universal tangent galvanometer. This instrument may be
used as a tangent, Gaugain, Helmholtz-Gaugain, sine, cosine, Wiedemann or detector
galvanometer. The coils, which slide on a beam parallel to the one carrying the needle box,
are wound on brass rings 12 inches in diameter. On each ring are wound two coils of 48
turns each, connected to separate binding posts, and double wound so as to be of equal
resistance. The coils and needle box are each provided with an indicator for reading their
position on the scale. The needle box is swivelled and removable and one coil may be
rotated about its vertical axis and its position read on a disc graduated in degrees. Currents
may be measured ranging from .000002 ampere to 100 amperes.
</p>
</div>
<p><b>Ques. Describe the construction of a sine galvanometer.</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. A form of sine galvanometer is shown in <a href="#Fig_524">fig. 524</a>. The
vertical wire coil is seen at M. A needle of any length less than
the diameter of the coil M, moves over the graduated circle N.
The coil M, and graduated circle N may be rotated on a vertical

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
axis, and the amount of angular movement necessary to bring
the needle to zero, measured on the graduated circle H.
</p>
<p><b>Ques. How is the current strength measured?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. It is proportional to the <i>sine</i> of the angle measured on
the horizontal circle H, through which it is necessary to turn the
coil M, from the plane of the earth's magnetic meridian to the
plane of the needle when it is not further deflected by the current.
</p>

    alt="Fig 524Sine galvanometer It differs from the tangent galvanometer in that the vertical" title="Fig 524Sine galvanometer It differs from the tangent galvanometer in that the vertical"
  />
<p class="caption"><a id="Fig_524"></a><span class="smcap">Fig</span>. 524.--Sine galvanometer. It differs from the tangent galvanometer in that the vertical
coil and magnetic needle are mounted upon a standard free to revolve around a vertical
axis, with provision for determining the angular position of the coil. The needle may be
of any length shorter than the diameter of the coil. In the figure the parts are: M, coil;
N, graduated dial of magnetic needle; H, graduated dial by which the amount of rotation
necessary to bring the needle to zero is measured; E, terminals of the coil; O, upright
standard carrying coil and graduated dial of magnetic needle; C, base with levelling screws.
</p>
</div>
<p><b>Ques. How is the sine galvanometer operated?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. In using the instrument, after the needle has been set
to zero, the current is sent through the coil, producing a deflection
of the needle. The coil is then rotated to follow the motion

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
of the needle, the current being kept constant, the rotation being
continued until the zero on the upper dial again registers with the
needle. The current then is proportional to the sine of the angle
through which the coil has been turned, as determined by the
lower dial.
</p>
<p><b>Ques. Has the sine galvanometer a large range?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. For a given controlling field, it does not admit of a very
large range of current measurement, since, for large deflection,
on rotating the coil the position of instability is soon reached.

<p><b>Ques. What is the position of instability?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. The position of the needle beyond which the rotation of
the coil will cause it to turn all the way round.
</p>
<p><b>Ques. How may the range be increased?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. By an adjustable controlling field or a shunt.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
<b>Ques. What advantage has the sine galvanometer over
the tangent instrument?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. Its advantage is in the case where the relative values
of two or more currents are required to be measured, or where
the constant of the instrument is obtained by comparison with
a standard measuring instrument and not calculated from the
dimensions of the coil, because all galvanometers thus used follow
the sine law independently of the shape of the coil, while only
circular coils will follow the sine law.

<p class="caption"><a id="Fig_525"></a><span class="smcap">Fig</span>. 525.--Differential galvanometer. It consists of two coils of wire, so wound as to have
opposite magnetic effects on a magnetic needle suspended centrally between them. The
needle of a differential galvanometer shows no deflection when two equal currents are
sent through the coils in opposite directions, since, under these conditions, each coil
neutralizes the effect of the other. Sometimes the current is so sent through the two coils,
that each coil deflects the needle in the same direction. In this case the instrument is no
longer differential in action. If, when this condition obtains, the magnetic needle be suspended
at the exact center of the line which joins the centers of the coils, the advantage
is gained by obtaining a field of more nearly uniform intensity around the needle. When
the needle is suspended by a silk fibre, a final and most delicate adjustment can be obtained
by raising or lowering one of the levelling screws slightly, so as to tilt the needle nearer to
or farther from one of the coils.
</p>
</div>
<p><b>The Differential Galvanometer.</b>--This is a form of galvanometer
in which a magnetic needle is suspended between two
coils of equal resistance so wound as to tend to deflect the needle
in opposite directions. The needle of a differential galvanometer

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
shows no deflection when two equal currents are sent through the
coils in opposite directions, since under these conditions, each
coil neutralizes the other's effects. Such instruments may be
used in comparing resistances, although the <i>Wheatstone bridge</i>,
in most cases, affords a preferable method.
</p>
<p><b>Ques. What is the special use of the differential galvanometer?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. It is used for comparing two currents.
</p>
<p><b>Ques. What is the method of comparing currents?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. If two equal currents be sent in opposite directions
through the coils of the galvanometer, the needle will not move;
if the currents be unequal, the needle will be deflected by the
stronger of them with an intensity corresponding to the difference
of the strengths of the two currents.
</p>
<p><b>Ques. How are the coils adjusted?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. This is done by coupling them in series in such a way
that they tend to turn the needle in opposite directions, and when
a current is passing through them, they are moved nearer to the
needle or farther from it until the needle stands at zero with any
current.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the coils be not movable, a turn or more can be unwound from the
coil giving the greatest magnetic effect until a balance is obtained, the
wire so unwound can then be coiled in the base of the instrument.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Ballistic Galvanometer.</b>--This type of galvanometer is
designed to measure the strength of momentary currents, such
for instance, as the discharge of a condenser. In construction
the magnetic system is given considerable weight, and arranged
to give the least possible <i>damping effect</i>.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
The term "damping effect" means the offering of a retarding force
to control swinging vibrations, such as the movements of a galvanometer
needle, and to bring them quickly to rest.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If a momentary current be passed through a ballistic galvanometer,
the impulse given to the needle does not cause appreciable
movement to the magnetic system until the current ceases,
owing to the inertia of the heavy moving parts, the result being
a slow swing of the needle.

easily removable and enclose a heavy block of copper fixed in a central fork. In a cylindrical
hole bored in this block hangs the bell magnet which with its mirror is suspended
by a long cocoon fibre, and the eddy currents induced in the copper bring the system quickly
to rest after a deflection. By lifting the copper block out of the frame the instrument is
made ballistic. The instrument is made with coils of any desired resistance up to 1,000 ohms.
</p>
</div>
<p><b>Ques. What name is given to the swing of a ballistic
galvanometer needle?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. It is called the <i>kick</i>.
</p>
<p><b>Ques. How is the current measured?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. As the needle swings slowly around it adds up, as it

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
were, the varying impulses received during the passage of the
momentary current, and <i>the quantity of electricity that has passed
is proportional to the sine of half the angle of the first swing or kick</i>.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If a reflecting method be used with a straight scale, the observed
deflection depends upon the tangent of twice the angle of movement
of the needle. For small deflections, however, the change of flux can be
taken as directly proportional to the observed deflection.

</p>
</div>
<p><b>Use of Mirrors in Galvanometers.</b>--In order that small
currents may be measured accurately, some means must be provided
to easily read a small deflection of the needle. Accordingly,
it is desirable that the pointer be very long so that a large number
of scale divisions may correspond to small deflections. In
construction, since sensitive galvanometers must be made with
the moving parts of little weight, it would not do to use a long
needle, hence a ray of light is used instead, which is reflected on a
distant scale by a small mirror attached to the moving part.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
In the Thompson mirror reflecting galvanometer, as shown in <a href="#Fig_528">fig. 528</a>,
a small vertical slit is cut in the lamp screen below the scale, and the ray
of light from the lamp, passing through the slit, strikes the mirror
which is about three feet distant, and which reflects the beam back to
the scale. It should be noted that the angle between the original ray
of light and the reflected ray is twice the angle of the deflection of the
mirror; the deflections of the ray of light on the scale, however, are
practically proportional to the strength of currents through the instrument.
The mirror arrangement as shown in <a href="#Fig_528">fig. 528</a>, requires a darkened
room for its operation, but such is not necessary when a telescope is used
as in <a href="#Fig_529">fig. 529</a>. Here the scale readings are reflected in the mirror and their
value observed by the telescope without artificial light.

<p><b>Damping.</b>--This relates to the checking or reduction of oscillations.
Thus, a galvanometer is said to be damped when so
constructed that any oscillations of the pointer which may be
started, rapidly die away. Galvanometers are frequently provided
with damping devices for the purpose of annulling these

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
oscillations, thus causing the moving part to assume its final
position as quickly as possible.
</p>
<p>Sometimes the instrument is fitted with a damping coil, or
closed coil so arranged with respect to the moving system that
the oscillations of the latter give rise to electric currents in the
closed coil, whereby energy is dissipated. Again, air vanes are
employed, but anything in the nature of solid friction cannot be
used.

It is mounted in an adjustable wooden frame. A straight filament lamp (110 volts) is
enclosed in a metal hood japanned black to cut out all reflected light. This form of filament
makes a single brilliant line on the scale, enabling closer readings than the "spot of light"

<p><b>D'Arsonval Galvanometer.</b>--This instrument has a movable
coil in place of a needle, and its operation depends upon the
principle that if a flat coil of wire be suspended with its axis
perpendicular to a strong magnetic field, it will be deflected whenever
a current of electricity passes through it.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
<b>Ques. Describe the construction of a D'Arsonval galvanometer.</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. The essential features are shown in figs. <a href="#Fig_532">532</a> and <a href="#Fig_533">533</a>.
The coil, which is rectangular in section is wound upon a copper
form, and suspended between a permanent magnet by fine wires
to the points A and B. The magnet has its poles at N and S. It
is a soft iron cylinder fixed between the poles in order to intensify
the magnetic field across the air gaps in which the coil moves.

of a galvanometer having suspended mirror moving system. It consists of a reading
telescope mounted as illustrated with a millimeter scale, having a length of 50 centimeters.
In use, the image of the scale is seen in the galvanometer mirror through the telescope. The
eye piece of the telescope has a cross hair which acts as a reference line so that by noting
the particular division on the scale when the galvanometer is at rest, the amount of deflection
can be readily observed when the galvanometer is deflected. The instrument has all
the necessary adjustments to set it up quickly and for bringing the cross hair and scale
in focus. It is generally placed at a distance of one meter from the galvanometer mirror.
</p>
</div>
<p><b>Ques. Explain its operation.</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. An enlarged horizontal cross section of the galvanometer
on line XY is shown in <a href="#Fig_533">fig. 533</a>. The current is flowing in
the coil as in <a href="#Fig_532">fig. 532</a>, up on the left side and down on the right.

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
The position of the coil when no current is flowing is indicated
by <i>n' s'</i>. By applying the law of mutual action between magnetic
poles, it is seen that when the current is applied, the poles
developed at <i>n' s'</i> will move into the position <i>n'' s''</i>. See fig. 119.
</p>
<p><b>Ques. How is the coil affected by a change in the direction
of the current?</b>

<p>Ans. The polarity of the coil is reversed and consequently
the direction of the deflection.

magnet D'Arsonval
galvanometer with telescope
and scale. It is very sensitive
and is used in many electrical
measurements, including commercial
testing, such as measuring
insulation of cables,
fault location, etc. It is not
affected by surrounding magnetic
disturbances, and may,
therefore, be used in proximity
to dynamos and switchboards.
The instrument has a pair of
binding post terminals, one
of which connects to a bottom
spiral of the system and the
other forms a junction with
the top of the tube holding the
system, forming a complete
circuit through the coil.  The
tube containing the system may be readily removed from the magnet and another tube having
a different system inserted as is required for various kinds of electrical measurement.
The entire system with its suspension may be inspected by the removal of a thumb screw.
To inspect interior of tube first be sure that the screw B is turned so that the coil is clamped.
Entirely remove screw C, and, holding the outside tube near the window, press firmly with
the finger on the extreme top of the suspension support. The inside rib, with complete
suspension, will draw from the tube, and the working parts can be fully inspected. Carefully
return same to its original position in tube, setting tight the screw C. The galvanometer
is designed so that the coil is clamped in position when the galvanometer must be
transported. The insulation of the galvanometer terminals and binding posts is such as to
guard against any possible leakage. As a further protection, each levelling screw is provided
with a hard rubber insulator. This feature is essential since, in making insulation measurements,
the operator wishes to be assured that the deflection being obtained is the result of
leakage upon the cable or wire being measured and not leakage between the galvanometer
terminals. The galvanometer is provided with an attached telescope and scale for noting
the deflections. The deflections produced by this galvanometer are proportional to the current.
To facilitate quickly setting up the instrument, two way levels are provided.
</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
<b>Ques. What causes this?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. The instrument is made dead beat by winding the coil
on a copper or aluminum frame, so that when in operation, currents
are induced in the frame by the motion of the coil in the
magnetic field; these currents oppose the motion of the coil.
</p>
<p><b>Ques. For what service is the D'Arsonval galvanometer
adapted?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. It is desirable for general use as it is not much affected
by changes in the magnetic field. It may be made with high
enough period and sensibility to be satisfactory as a ballistic
instrument, but for extreme sensibility an instrument of the
astatic type is more generally used.
</p>
<p><b>Galvanometer "Constant" or "Figure of Merit."</b>--In
order that a galvanometer shall be of value as a measuring instrument,
the relation between the current and the deflection
produced by it must be known. This may be obtained experimentally
by determining the value of the current required to
produce one scale division. The galvanometer constant then
may be defined as <i>the resistance through which the galvanometer
will give a deflection of one scale division when the current applied
is at a pressure of one volt</i>.
</p>
<p>Accordingly, the deflection as indicated on the scale must be
multiplied by its constant or figure of merit, in order to obtain
the correct reading. If the scale readings be not directly proportional
to the quantity to be measured, the law of the instrument
must also be considered.

the other to a travelling point whose position is varied by means of plugs or by a dial switch.
</p>
</div>
<p><b>Galvanometer Shunts</b>.--The sensitiveness of a galvanometer
used for measuring current may be reduced to any desired extent
by connecting a resistance of known value in parallel with it.
Thus, if it be desired to measure a current greater than can be

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
measured directly by the galvanometer, a part of the current
can be sent through the resistance or shunt, and the total value
of the current calculated.
</p>
<p>A galvanometer shunt bears a definite ratio to the resistance
of the galvanometer, being usually adjusted so that only .1,
.01, or .001 part of the current passes through the galvanometer.
</p>
<p>The degree in which a shunt increases the range of deflection
of a galvanometer is called its "multiplying power."

<p>If .1 of the current flowing, passed through the galvanometer and .9

<p>When it is essential that the total resistance of the circuit

inserts a resistance for each shunt in series with the shunted

TESTING AND TESTING APPARATUS
</h2>
<p>The practical electrician frequently has to make tests of
various kinds which require the rapid and accurate measurement
of voltage, current and resistance. It is therefore essential that
he understand the methods employed in testing and the operation
of the instruments used.
</p>
<p>Most tests are made with a galvanometer, and the devices,
such as resistances, switches, etc., which are used in connection
with the galvanometer may be obtained put up in a neat and
substantial box together with the galvanometer, the combination
being called a "testing set." Numerous forms of testing set are
illustrated in this chapter.
</p>
<p>The construction, use, and operation of the various types of
galvanometer have been explained in chapter twenty-six.
Ammeters and voltmeters, which are simply special forms of
galvanometer, and which are largely used are fully described
in the preceding chapter.
</p>
<p><b>Pressure Measurement.</b>--An electromotive force has been
defined as that which causes or tends to cause a current; it is
analogous to water pressure; potential difference corresponds to
difference of level. The <i>total</i> electromotive force of a circuit is

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
independent of resistance or current, and cannot be limited to
mean the fall of pressure between any two points, as for instance
the terminals of a battery.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the pressure of a battery be two volts when measured on open
circuit by a static voltmeter, there will still be two volts on closed
circuit, but there will now be a loss of pressure through the internal
resistance of the battery and the voltage across the terminals will be less
than the <i>total</i> voltage. The static voltmeter, never closing the circuit,
actually measures the total voltage.

glass. To set up the cell, place mercury in one limb, and in the other hot liquid amalgam,
containing 90 parts mercury and 10 parts zinc. The platinum wires at the bottom must
be completely covered by the mercury and the amalgam, respectively. On the mercury,
place a layer 1 cm. thick of the zinc and mercurous sulphate paste. Both this paste and
the zinc amalgam must be covered with a layer of the neutral zinc sulphate crystals 1 cm.
thick. The whole vessel must then be filled with the saturated zinc sulphate solution,
and the stopper inserted so that it shall just touch it, leaving, however, a small bubble
to guard against breakage when the temperature rises. Before finally inserting the glass
stopper a strong alcoholic solution of shellac is applied to the upper edge, after which
the stopper is pressed firmly in place.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
<b>Ques. What error is introduced in measuring the
pressure of a battery with an ordinary voltmeter?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. Since the measurement is made on <i>closed circuit</i> the
reading does not give the total pressure of the battery.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The error is very slight because the resistance of the voltmeter is very
high and the current so small that the loss of pressure in the battery
can be neglected.

(coulombs in <a href="#Fig_543">fig. 543</a>) is 1 × 60 × 60 = 3,600 gallons. Following the analogy further (in
<a href="#Fig_543">fig. 543</a>), the pressure of one volt is required to force the electricity through the resistance
of one ohm between the terminals A and B. In <a href="#Fig_542">fig. 542</a>, the boiler must furnish steam
pressure on the pump piston to overcome the friction (resistance) offered by the pipe
and raise the water from the lower level A' to the higher level B'. The difference of
pressure between A and B in the electric circuit corresponds to the difference of pressure
between A' and B'. The cell furnishes the energy to move the current by maintaining a
difference of pressure at its terminals C and D; similarly, the boiler furnishes energy
to raise the water by maintaining a difference of pressure between the steam pipe C and

<p><b>Resistance Measurement.</b>--<i>Resistance is that which offers
opposition to the flow of electricity.</i> Ohm's law shows that the
strength of the current falls off in proportion as the resistance in
the circuit increases. This gives a basis for measuring resistance.
</p>
<p>There are various methods by which an unknown resistance
may be measured, as by the:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Direct deflection method;
</li>
<li>Method of substitution;
</li>
<li>Fall of potential method;

<li>Voltmeter method;

<li>Wheatstone bridge method.

</ol>
<p><b>Direct Deflection Method.</b>--This method is based on the
fact that the greater the current through a galvanometer the
greater the deflection of the needle; it is a simple method and is
capable of extended application.
</p>
<p>The apparatus required consists of battery, galvanometer,
known resistance, and double contact key. The connections are
made as in <a href="#Fig_550">fig. 550</a>. The known resistance is put in circuit with
the galvanometer and after noting the deflection, the key is
moved so as to cut out the known resistance and throw into
circuit the unknown resistance. The deflection of the galvanometer
is again noted and compared with the first deflection.

resistance will be as many times the known resistance as the
deflection with the known resistance is greater than the deflection
with the unknown resistance.

<b>Method of Substitution.</b>--This is the simplest method of
measuring resistance. The resistance to be measured is inserted
in series with a galvanometer and some constant source of
current, and the galvanometer deflection noted. A known adjustable
resistance is then substituted for the unknown and
adjusted till the same deflection is again obtained. The value
of the adjustable resistance thus obtained is equal to that of
the resistance being tested.

same as in <a href="#Fig_550">fig. 550</a>, except that a resistance box is used in place of the known resistance.
In making the test, first note deflection with unknown resistance in circuit, then press
key so that the current will pass through the resistance box, and adjust the resistance in
the box so that the deflection of the galvanometer is about the same as with the unknown.
Now switch from one circuit to the other, changing the resistance in the box until equal
deflections are obtained. When this obtains, the resistance in the box is the same as
the resistance being tested.

</p>
<p>Ans. It consists of a box containing numerous resistance
coils with their ends connected to terminals and provided with
plugs so that they may be thrown into or out of circuit at will,
thus varying the resistance in the circuit.

a voltmeter having small resistance is used, it should be connected
so as to measure the fall of pressure across both ammeter
and unknown resistance as shown in <a href="#Fig_556">fig. 556</a>.

<p><b>Differential Galvanometer Method.</b>--This is what is
known as a <i>nil</i> or zero method, that is, a method of making

two quantities by reducing one to equality with the other, the
absence of deflection from zero of the instrument scale showing

</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
The test is made with a differential galvanometer, and resistance
box connected as in <a href="#Fig_557">fig. 557</a>. The current then will
divide so that part of it flows through the resistance being tested
and around one set of coils of the galvanometer while the other
part will flow through the resistance box and the other set of
coils as indicated. When the resistance box has been so adjusted
that its resistance is the same as the unknown resistance the
current in the two branches will be equal, and the needle of the
galvanometer will show <i>no deflection</i>.

<p><b>Ques. For what kind  of resistance is the method
adapted?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. Since it is a nil or zero method, it is better adapted to
the measurement of non-inductive than of inductive resistances.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
<b>Ques. What precaution should be taken with inductive
resistances?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. The current must be allowed to flow until it becomes
steady to overcome the influence of self-induction.

<p>The bridge consists of a system of conductors as shown in
<a href="#Fig_564">fig. 564</a>. The circuit of a constant battery is made to branch at
P into two parts, which re-unite at Q, so that part of the current
flows through the point M, the other part through the point N.
The four conductors A, B, C, D, are spoken of as the <i>arms</i> of
the balance or bridge. It is by the proportion existing between

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
the resistances of these arms that the resistance of one of them
can be calculated when the resistances of the other three are
known. When the current which starts from the battery arrives
at P, the pressure will have fallen to a certain value. The pressure
in the upper branch falls again to M, and continues to fall to Q.
The pressure of the lower branch falls to N, and again falls till it
reaches the value at Q. Now if N be the same proportionate
distance along the resistances between P and Q, as M is along
the resistances of the upper line between P and Q, the pressure
will have fallen at N to the same value as it has fallen to at M;
or, in other words, if the ratio of the resistance C to the resistance
D be equal to the ratio between the resistance A and the resistance
B, then M and N will be at equal pressures. To find out
if this condition obtain, a sensitive galvanometer is placed in a

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
branch wire between M and N which will show <i>no</i> deflection when
M and N are at equal pressure or when the four resistances of the
arms "balance" one another by being in proportion, thus:

<div class='eq'>
(1)  A:C = B:D<br />

<p class='cont'>If, then, the value of A, B, and C be known, D can be calculated.

arms of the bridge. There is a choice of several different ways of arranging these coils.
The figure shows the simplest arrangement, which is employed in boxes not intended for the
highest accuracy. The required ratio, as for instance 1:100, is obtained by withdrawing a
plug from each arm A and B. Ratios 1/1, 1/10, 1/100, 10/100, etc., or 1,000/1, 1,000/10, 1,000/100, 100/100, etc., are
obtainable in this manner. This simple arrangement is open not only to the objection
that the contact resistance of the plugs which remain in is always included with the resistance
unplugged, but also to all other objections to be urged against the use of many
plugs where a few will do. The method has the limitation that it is not possible to reverse
the arms of the bridge, that is, to transpose the arms A and B.

</div>
<p><b>Ques. Why should the battery key be depressed before
the galvanometer key?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. To avoid the sudden swing of the galvanometer needle,
which occurs on closing circuit in consequence of self-induction.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>
<b>Ques. How is it known whether too much or too little
resistance be unplugged?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. The galvanometer needle will be deflected to one side
for too much resistance, and to the opposite side for too little
resistance.

<p class="caption"><a id="Fig_569"></a><span class="smcap">Fig</span>. 569.--Method of reversing arms of Wheatstone bridge with reversing blocks. The arrangement
shown in the figure is classical, being that used in the English post office type of
Wheatstone bridge. It is open to the objections which apply to the use of several plugs,
one of which is withdrawn to obtain the desired resistance.
</p>
</div>
<p><b>Ques. What is the meaning of "Inf.," marked on the
bridge?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. It stands for "infinity," because the resistance coil at
the point marked infinity is omitted so that adjacent sections of
the arm are disconnected when the plug is taken out.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In fact, the air gap interposed by the removal of the plug by no means
provides an infinitely great resistance, but is usually called such because
it is vastly greater than any of the other resistances of the bridge.

illustrating the
decade plan of combining
resistance coils. In
this method the coils are
connected in series and
the arrangement avoids
the disadvantage of the
ordinary Wheatstone bridge in that the latter
requires a large number of plugs to short
circuit the resistances not in use, which
introduces an element of uncertainty as to
resistance of the plug contacts and the
necessity of adding up the values of all the
unplugged resistances in order to determine
the total resistance in circuit. The
necessary regular succession of values in a
rheostat built on the decade plan can be
obtained with either nine or ten coils per
decade. The chief reason for using the
latter number is found in the facility with
which all the coils of one decade can be
compared with one coil of the next
higher decade, thus permitting the coils
of a rheostat to be checked among themselves.
Thus, the ten 1 ohm coils can be
checked with a 10 ohm, the ten 10's with a
100, etc. In some sets the ten coils of a
decade can be connected in series or in
parallel, and it then becomes an advantage to have ten coils to a decade, since the coils in
one decade in parallel equal one of the coils of the next lower decade. When these latter
advantages are not required, and especially when dials or sliding switches are used, there
is little or no advantage in using more than nine coils per decade, as shown in <a href="#Fig_570">fig. 570</a>.
Here all the coils of the set are connected in series so that the circuit is never open. Thus it
is a slight advantage to have permanent connections <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, and <i>c</i>, because all the coils of a
decade can be thrown in circuit by simply pulling out a plug, it not being necessary to
insert it again, as would be the case if the <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, and <i>c</i> connections were not used. Moreover,
if any plug make bad contact, its effect is somewhat lessened by having this bad
contact shunted by the remaining coils of the decade. Again, there are occasions where
violent deflections of a galvanometer are prevented by not having the circuit entirely
open when a plug is taken out.

<b>The Decade Plan.</b>--In this method of combining resistance
coils, there are 9 or 10 one ohm coils for the units place, 9 or 10
ten ohm coils for the tens place, 9 or 10 one hundred ohm coils
for the hundreds place and so on. Each series of coils of the
same value is designated a <i>decade</i>. The connections are usually
made as shown in figs. <a href="#Fig_570">570</a> and <a href="#Fig_571">571</a>.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is apparent from the figure that any value in any one decade can
be obtained by inserting between a bar and a block, only one plug;
moreover if several decades be in series, any value up to the limit of the
set can be read off directly from the position of the plugs without having
to add up the unplugged resistance as in the ordinary arrangement.

  />
<p class="caption"><a id="Fig_572"></a><span class="smcap">Fig</span>. 572.--Two plug arrangement of ratio coils. Each of the ratio coils has one of its terminals
connected to a common center which corresponds to the block marked C in the figure. The
other terminal of each coil is connected to an individual block, there being one block for
each coil. The bar B on one side of these blocks is joined to the rheostat and the bar A
on the other side to an X post. In the ordinary use of this set of ratio coils two plugs only
are used. One plug is inserted between the bar A and one of the blocks, 1, 1', 10, 10', etc.,
of the central row of blocks. The other plug is inserted between the bar B and any one
of the other blocks of the central row. There are two ratio coils of each value. To obtain
an even ratio as 1,000 to 1,000', one plug is inserted between the block 1,000 and the bar
A, and the other plug between the 1,000 block and bar B, the ratio arms are reversed;
that is, the 1,000 ohm coil is connected to the X post and the 1,000 ohm coil to the end of
the rheostat. When uneven ratios are used, the same ratio can be obtained by four different
combinations. To obtain the ratio one to ten, insert a plug between A and 1, and another
between B and 10, or between A and 1', and B and 10, and get 1:10, or between A and 1,
and B and 10', and get 1:10', or again, between A and 1' and B and 10', and get 1' to 10'.
Other ratios are obtained in a similar manner. By using more than two plugs and
connecting certain of the coils in parallel combinations, a large number of other ratios
may be obtained. This arrangement offers a convenient method of measuring the sensibility
of a bridge and galvanometer combination that is frequently applicable. If for
instance the one ohm coil is used on either side after a balance has been obtained the one
ohm may be shunted with the 1,000 ohm on the same side. This will make a variation of
1/10 of 1% and the galvanometer deflection may be noted for this variation. Similarly,
the 1 ohm may be shunted with the 100 for a variation of 1%, or with the 10,000 for a
variation of 1/100 of 1%. The ten ohm coil may be shunted with the 1,000 for a variation
of 1% and with the 10,000 for a variation of 1/10 of 1%. In the arrangement of ratio coils,
errors due to plug contacts are negligible because only two plug contacts enter the circuit,
and with an even ratio, it is only the difference in the resistances of the two plug contacts
that can affect the result. In measuring any of the ratio coils while in the box it is only
necessary to connect to the bar C and to either the bar A or B and plug in the coils to be
measured.

<p class="caption"><a id="Fig_574"></a><span class="smcap">Figs</span>. 573 and 574.--The Leeds and
Northrup decade. The object of
this arrangement is to reduce the
number of coils required. In <a href="#Fig_573">fig. 573</a>,
the 1, 3', 3 and 2 are connected
in series. Let the terminals
of the 1 ohm and 2 ohm
coils be numbered (1), (2), (3),
(4) and (5) (<a href='#Fig_573'>fig. 573</a>). The current
enters at point (1) and
leaves the coils at the point (5),
traversing 1, 3', 3, 2 = 9 ohms in
all. If this series be multiplied
by any factor <i>n</i>, then <i>n</i> (1 + 3' +
3 + 2) = <i>n</i> 9 ohms. It will be
seen that if the points (1) and
(5) be connected, all the coils
are short circuited, and the current
will traverse zero resistance.
If the points (2) and (5) be connected,
the 3', 3 and 2 ohm coils
will be short circuited and the
current will traverse 1 ohm. By
extending the process so as to
connect two and only two points
at a time it is possible to obtain
the regular succession of values n
(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), the last
being obtained when no points
are connected. <a href="#Fig_574">Fig. 574</a> shows
Leeds and Northrup's method of
connecting these points two at a
time with the use of a single plug.
The circles in the diagram represent
two rows of ten brass blocks
each. To the first two blocks at
the top of the rows, the points (5)
and (1), <a href="#Fig_573">fig. 573</a>, are connected;
to the second two, the points (2)
and (5) are connected, etc., no
points being connected to the last
pair of blocks. Hence, if a plug
be inserted between blocks 1 and
5, <a href="#Fig_575">fig. 575</a>, the points (1) and (5) of
diagram <a href="#Fig_573">fig. 573</a> are connected,
giving the value of 0, if between
the blocks 2 and 5 the points (2)
and (5) are connected, giving the
value 1, and so on. The value
9 is obtainable when the plug is
in the last pair of blocks, which
have no connections. <a href="#Fig_572">Fig. 572</a>
shows a top view of the blocks
of a simple decade constructed
upon this plan.

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_497">[497]</a></span>
<b>Ques. What other advantages are gained with the
decade arrangement?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. The single plug used with each decade is never out of
use, being either in the zero position or set on some value, and is
therefore not easily lost by being laid aside. The use of only one
plug in a decade makes it easy to ascertain that the plug is
making good contact as only one block in a row is plugged at a
time, the other blocks are not kept under a strain by having
plugs forced tightly between them.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This strain on the blocks, which always exists in those sets in which
a resistance is thrown in by removing a plug, tends to separate or loosen
them and often to warp the hard rubber upon which they are mounted.
Another advantage of the decade plan is that it permits obtaining a
succession of values by means of sliding contacts or dial switches, a
method which is becoming deservedly more appreciated.

the set a theoretical range from .001 of an ohm to 11,110,000 ohms. For resistances above
1,000,000 ohms, the normal battery power must be increased. The contact keys are

<p class="caption"><a id="Fig_577"></a><span class="smcap">Fig</span>. 577.--Connections and circuits of Queen acme portable testing set. There are three
rows of blocks, LL', MM', NN'. LL is connected to NN' by means of a heavy copper
bar, joining L' and N'. LL' and NN' constitute the rheostat, from which any resistance
from 1 ohm to 11,110 ohms may be obtained by removing the proper plugs. The block N
of the rheostat is connected to the lower line post D. The upper line post C is connected
to the block X of the commutator. The block C has no other permanent connection,
except key G. The block R of the commutator is connected to the block L of the rheostat,
and has no other connection, excepting by plugs. Each half of MM' constitutes a bridge arm,
designated A and B respectively. Beginning at the lower line post D, the connections
form a continuous circuit through the rheostat, thence through the bridge arm B, thence
through the bridge arm A, thence to the upper line post C. The commutator serves
merely to reverse the bridge arms A and B. The battery terminals are connected as
shown: the positive terminal directly to the common junction of the two bridge arms,
and the negative terminal through the battery key to the rheostat. The positive terminal
of the galvanometer is connected through the galvanometer key with the block X, and
the negative terminal with the block R of the commutator or what is equivalent, with
the block L of the rheostat. The commutator blocks A, B, R and X, are connected by
plugs as shown. When the commutator plugs are in the position PQ, the bridge arm B
is connected to the rheostat and the bridge arm A is connected to the line, the ratio
between the bridge arms ratio being A ÷ B = X ÷ R but when the plugs are in the
position ST, the bridge arms are reversed in position A, being connected with the rheostat
and B, with the line, and the bridge arm ratio becomes A ÷ B = R ÷ X. The connections

<p><b>Ques. Describe the operation of the Queen Acme testing
set figs. <a href="#Fig_576">576</a> and <a href="#Fig_577">577</a>, in measuring resistance.</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. Connect the terminals of the resistance to be measured
to the line posts C and D. Place the battery connections on
the two upper tips 0 and 1, thus throwing one end of the battery
into circuit, which is sufficient until an approximate balance is
obtained. Employ the 100 ohm coil in each bridge arm, and
place the commutator plugs in the position PQ, or in the position
ST. Then remove plugs from the rheostat until the value of
total resistance employed, or nearly as may be guessed is equal
to that of the unknown resistance. Now press the battery key
Ba, and holding it down momentarily, press the galvanometer
key Ga. If the galvanometer needle swing to the right toward
the symbol + the resistance employed in the rheostat is too
high and must be reduced. If the needle swing to the left
toward -, the resistance employed is too low and must be increased.
By altering the resistance of the rheostat accordingly,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>
a value will soon be found, which when varied slightly either
way, will reverse the deflection of the galvanometer needle.
Now remove the battery connection from tip 1, and place it on
the tip 4, thus throwing the whole battery into circuit. Then
press the keys again as before, first the battery key, then the
galvanometer key. This will increase the deflection of the galvanometer
needle for the same variation in the rheostat, thus

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>
enabling the making of a more accurate adjustment. The
measurement thus made will be the best result that can be
obtained with bridge arms of equal value, but by selecting more
suitable values of the two arms from the following table of
bridge ratios a much higher degree of accuracy may be obtained.

long, 7" wide and 7" deep, and weighs 11-1/2 pounds. The resistances are arranged upon the
dial decade plan, being placed in circuit by means of a rotating switch contact. The
switches are so constructed that they may be turned in either direction, thereby permitting
them to be turned quickly from the highest resistance in any dial to the lowest
resistance in the same dial. This arrangement avoids the necessity of turning back
through all the remaining resistances in any particular group of coils and is of  value in
locating swinging crosses or conditions of momentary balances. The connections for the
various tests are made by the manipulation of one small knife switch (W.B.--M.L.) and
the switch BA.; these are plainly lettered, thus avoiding the necessity of referring to a
diagram of connections. In construction, the dial switches are made up of eight laminations
of No. 28 B. &amp; S. phosphor bronze, and the form is such as to prevent wearing grooves
on the top of the contact studs. In this instrument the electrical circuits are soldered
throughout excepting the switch contact whose resistance is negligible. The resistances
are wound with manganin. The battery comprises six cells sub-divided which are easily
replaceable. The galvanometer is the same as in the Queen acme set, but has the addition
of an Ayrton shunt, which is useful in making insulation measurements. The necessary
keys, binding posts, and switches are provided so as to facilitate the use of the instrument
for the various measurements that can be made with it.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_503">[503]</a></span>
When the plugs are placed in the ST position, the unknown resistance
is found by dividing the value of the larger bridge arm by that of the
smaller, and multiplying the total employed resistance in the rheostat

the keys and obtain a deflection of the galvanometer needle.
For example: assume that the needle to be deflected about 8
divisions of the scale. Since this deflection is due to the current
from one cell passing through a resistance of 100,000 ohms, then
100,000 × 8 = .8 megohms represents the resistance through
which one cell will produce a deflection of one division on the

are provided. In the direct reading type, the scale is so cut that when the galvanometer
is balanced, the pointer of the instrument indicates the value of the resistance between the
X posts. The scale is calibrated for any desired range. These ohmmeters being slide wire
bridges, the greatest accuracy is at the center of the scale, hence one should be selected
that will bring the part of the scale likely to be the most used at or near the center. A convenient
type is that in which the scale is cut in per cent., 100 per cent. being at the center
of the scale. Fixed coils of 1, 10, 100, 1,000 and 10,000 ohms are contained in the instrument
with a plugging arrangement allowing any one to be used. When a balance is obtained,
the actual resistance is determined by multiplying the dial reading by the value of the

It is used to measure conductor resistance, fault resistance, to locate faults by four different
tests, and when used with a buzzer and telephone, to locate opens. The essential
feature of the instrument is the uniform resistance AB, which lies in a circle and which
has a value of about 100 ohms. By a special construction, it is so arranged that the
contact can be made at any point along it, and it is therefore equivalent to a very high
resistance slide wire. It has a moving contact C and a uniform scale of 1,000 divisions.
In series with this, there are the two resistances E and R which may be short circuited
by the switches U and V. E has exactly the same resistance as the wire AB. R has a
resistance of 100 ohms, and is the fixed resistance of the bridge arrangement for resistance
measurements. The resistances of 1,000 ohms and 9,000 ohms connected to the battery
post are to protect the battery and the apparatus from excessive current. The 9,000 ohms

<b>The Varley Loop.</b>--This is a method of locating a cross or
ground in a telephone or telegraph line or other cable by using
a Wheatstone bridge in a loop formed of a good wire and the
faulty wire joined at their distance ends. One terminal of the
battery is grounded and the other connected to a point on the
bridge at the junction of the ratio arms. The rheostat arm then
includes the resistance of the rheostat plus the resistance of the
fault, while the unknown arm includes the resistance of the good
wire plus the resistance of the bad wire beyond the fault. When
the bridge is balanced, the unknown resistances may be readily
determined by a simple equation.

<p><b>The Potentiometer.</b>--For the rapid and accurate measurement
of voltage, current, and resistance, the potentiometer can
be recommended. Those in charge of electric light and power
companies, and also those who purchase large amounts of
electrical energy are realizing, more and more, the necessity of
having satisfactory primary standards with which to check their
volt-, ampere-, and watt-meters.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_521">[521]</a></span>
When it is realized that an error of one per cent. in a commercial
instrument means an error of one dollar one way or
the other in every one hundred dollars charged, the need of
such standardization apparatus becomes at once apparent.
</p>
<p>The potentiometer, it should be noted, relies for its accuracy,
only upon the constancy and accuracy of resistances and upon
standard cells.
</p>
<p>With the materials now available, and the skill which has been
acquired in their manufacture, both the resistances and the
standard cells are obtainable which are remarkably constant,
and both can be readily checked for accuracy.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_522">[522]</a></span>
<b>Location of Opens.</b>--These measurements are based on the
fact that the capacity of wires in a cable is ordinarily a measurable
quantity, which, in wire of uniform diameter, is proportionate
to length. In making these tests, a fault finder is used
together with a buzzer, dry cells to operate it, small induction
coil, and telephone receiver. These instruments are to be
found in any telephone exchange. It is best to locate the
buzzer at some distance from the fault finder in order that it
cannot be heard by the operator.

<p class="caption"><a id="Fig_606"></a><span class="smcap">Fig</span>. 606.--To measure high resistances, such as the resistances of faults with Leeds and
Northrup fault finder. <i>First Method.</i>--Arrange the switches as shown in the figure. Connect
posts Gr. and 2, turn the handle until the galvanometer needle comes to rest at an even
deflection of ten divisions. Call the reading A. Connect in the unknown resistance
between Gr. and 2. Now close the switch W, so that the figure 1 appears on the top of
the block, and again bring the galvanometer to a deflection of ten divisions and call the
reading B. Then X = (10,000 B ÷ A) - 1,000. In case X be a high resistance, it will
be found that the galvanometer will not deflect ten divisions for any position of the pointer.
In such case, choose a number of divisions which is a factor of ten, such as 5, 2, or 1, and
multiply (10,000 B ÷ A) by ten divided by the number chosen, as 10/5, 10/2, 10/1. For example,
for a deflection of two divisions: X = (10/2)(10,000 B ÷ A) - 1,000. The satisfactory
range of the set for high resistance measurement may be increased by using an outside
battery of higher voltage. With the contained battery, satisfactory measurements can
be made up to 1 or 2 megohms. When outside battery is used, connect one terminal to
the post Ba, and the other to 2 for the reading A. Connect the battery and unknown
resistance in series between these posts for the reading B. When an outside pressure of
25 volts or over is used, the switch W should not be closed unless there be a resistance in
series with the battery of 10,000 ohms or over. <i>Second Method.</i>--For use as a voltmeter
to measure high resistances. (More convenient but not quite as accurate as first method.)
Set the switches to RV, M and 10. Turn the knurled nut on the galvanometer so as to
set the needle to the extreme right hand side of the scale. Connect the posts 2 and Gr.
with a short piece of wire. Turn the rotating pointer on the scale until the galvanometer
needle moves over about 20 scale divisions when the battery key is closed. Remove the
connection between 2 and Gr. as the voltmeter terminals. This makes a simple way
of testing for various kinds and amounts of trouble. On a wet cable a deflection of 10
to 15 divisions indicates heavy enough trouble to locate with the fault finder. With a
little care, trouble showing only 5 or 6 divisions can be located.

mile and join together the mate of the broken wire and one wire
of the other pair. Make the connections as shown in <a href="#Fig_607">fig. 607</a>,

gives it the maximum sensibility. Compared with high resistance potentiometer, this is
especially advantageous in measuring the electromotive force of thermocouples, and the
fall of potential across standard low resistances. As constructed, the last one-tenth volt is
covered by the extended wire and the handle which carries the contact point on the wire
may be manipulated rapidly so that a fluctuating voltage may be accurately followed.

the potentiometer resistances can be verified with the facilities of the ordinary laboratory.

<p class="caption"><a id="Fig_611"></a><span class="smcap">Fig</span>. 611.--Diagram showing connections of Leeds and Northrup potentiometer. The coils in
the series AD are each 5 ohms, and between each two there is a brass block with a reamed
hole. A pair of flexible cords with taper plug terminals to fit these holes is furnished.
These coils can be measured with an ordinary Wheatstone bridge and thus compared
with each other to a high degree of accuracy, even if the bridge be not accurate. For
potentiometer work, the essential point is that they should be like each other, not that
they should be accurately any particular value. In the same way the resistance of the
extended wire can be compared with the resistance of the coils in AD. Its resistance
should be 1.1 times the value of any coil between A and D. Outside connection with the
extended wire may be made by using the posts marked BR and -BA. This adjustment
for balancing an unknown electromotive force is accomplished by the manipulation of the
two contact points M and M'. The coils AD are arranged in a circle, a revolving switch
moving M. A checking device enables the operator to set this switch without taking his
eye from the galvanometer. The resistance S is of such value that when it shunts the
wire OB, the total resistance between O and B is 1/10 of the same unshunted. When the
shunt is applied, provided the total current remain the same, the drop between any two
points on AB will be 1/10 of its previous value. The total current will remain the same
provided the total resistance in the circuit remain the same. This is accomplished by
making the coil K such that it exactly compensates for the reduction in resistance caused
by plugging in the shunt coil S. The low scale is applied by moving the plug from the
position 1 to the position .1. With this change the potentiometer reads from .16 volt
down by indicated steps of .000005 volt. The reading is very simple. For instance, if M
stand at 1.2 and M' at 1.35 revolutions, the reading is 1.2135 volts. The resistances of
the instrument are wound upon metal spools, and are therefore able to dissipate a comparatively
large amount of energy. This allows the potentiometer to be used for pressure
measurements up to 16 volts without the use of a volt box.

is made by means of the variable resistance R. Fine adjustment is made by means of the
variable resistance R'. It will be noted that the 23 ohm resistance of this latter rheostat
is shunted by a resistance of 6.1 ohms, making possible a very fine regulation. Further,
there is in series with the moving contact a resistance of 400 ohms, which makes the effect
of variable contact resistance negligible. Only one cell of storage battery should be used.
When this battery is fresh, the plug shown in the figure at 2R should be inserted at R.
This gives the greatest resistance in the rheostat circuit. As the cell runs down, the plug
should be changed to 2R. When both plugs are in, the rheostat slide wires are in series
with the potentiometer circuit.

its length. Necessary circuits are plainly shown in the figure; SC, is a <i>standard cell</i> and
C, the cell to be tested. M, and S are sliding contacts, connecting with the "slide wire."
</p>
</div>
<p><b>Ques. Describe the method of measuring the voltage
of a cell with a potentiometer.</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. <a href="#Fig_614">Fig. 614</a> shows a method of comparing a pressure with
that of a standard cell and is applicable whether the pressure of
the cell to be tested be greater or less than that of the standard
cell. In making the test the switch F is first closed, then the
other switch is moved to D, and M adjusted till galvanometer
shows no deflection; similarly, the switch is moved to G, and S
adjusted till galvanometer shows no deflection. Then,
C:SC = AS:AM. from which C = SC × AS ÷ AM.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_531">[531]</a></span>
EXAMPLE.--Let 1.016 volts be the known voltage of the standard cell
SC, and the scale reading of AS be 657, and of AM, 225 as in the
figure, then
</p>

<div class='eq'>
C = (1.016 × 657) / 225 = 2.966 volts<br />
</div>
<p>The arrangement may, however, be made direct reading, that is, the
slide wire may have a scale of volts instead of lengths or resistances, as
follows: Suppose the standard cell to have a pressure of 1.434 volts, the
sliding contact M is placed at the reading 1.434, and the adjustable
resistance varied till the galvanometer shows no current. This means
that the pressure between A and M is 1.434, and consequently the pressures
all along the slide can be read off the scale <i>in volts</i>. Hence, when S
has been adjusted to balance, the pressure of C is read off the scale in volts.

by using a volt box or multiplier. To measure high voltages it is necessary to connect the
voltage across high resistance and to measure on the potentiometer a definite fraction of
the total drop. In the figure, AB is a high resistance of which CB is .1th, DB .01th, and
EB .001th of the total resistance. The potentiometer reading is accordingly multiplied
by 10, 100, or 1,000, depending upon whether the switch M is set on C, D, or E. Resistance
boxes for this purpose are called <i>volt boxes</i>, and are constructed to multiply the potentiometer
readings by 10, 100, and 1,000. In using them, it is only necessary to connect the
unknown E.M.F. at the posts so marked, and the potentiometer to the posts marked P.
The potentiometer reading is taken as above and multiplied by a factor depending upon
the position of the switch M, which factor is indicated upon the box. <i>It is essential in
making these connections that the polarity be carefully observed.</i>
</p>
</div>
<p><b>How to Use a Potentiometer.</b>--All connections must be
made as indicated by the stamping on the instrument. Particular
attention must be given to the polarity of the standard cell, of
the battery, and of the voltage, the corresponding + and - signs
being marked. If used with a wall galvanometer having a
telescope and scale, it will be found convenient to place the
potentiometer so that the telescope is directly over the glass
index of the extended wire, thus permitting the observer to read
the galvanometer deflections and potentiometer settings without
changing his position.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Potentiometer Current.</b>--A medium sized storage cell will be
found desirable, producing a steady current. Errors in measurements
are frequently made by using an unsteady current.
</p>
<p><b>Setting for Standard Cell.</b>--Set the standard cell to correspond
with the certified pressure of the standard cell as given in its certificate.
In using the potentiometer shown in <a href="#Fig_610">fig. 610</a>, place the plug in hole 1,
and see that it is always in this position when checking against the
standard cell. Place the double throw switch at STD. CELL.
</p>
<p>Adjust the regulating rheostat until the galvanometer shows no
deflection. In making the first adjustment use the key marked R<sub>1</sub>;
when a balance is almost attained, use key R<sub>2</sub>, and for the final
adjustment use key marked R<sub>0</sub>. This cuts out the resistance in series
with the galvanometer and gives the maximum sensibility.
</p>
<p><b>Measurement of Unknown Pressure.</b>--The potentiometer (<a href='#Fig_610'>fig. 610</a>),
as ordinarily used, gives direct readings for voltages up to and
including 1.6 volts. For pressures higher than 1.6 volts, a volt box or
multiplier should be used. After obtaining the standard cell balance,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_532">[532]</a></span>
as previously described, place the double throw switch in the position
marked E.M.F. The balance for the unknown E.M.F. is obtained by
manipulating the tenths switch and rotating the contact on the extended
potentiometer wire. The final position of the two contacts in conjunction
with the position of the plug at the left of the instrument indicates the
voltage under test.
</p>
<p>As directed above, use key R<sub>1</sub> for rough adjustment, R<sub>2</sub> for intermediate
adjustment, and key R<sub>0</sub> for final adjustment.
</p>
<p>Plug at 1 gives readings for voltage directly from settings of tenths
switch and extended wire contact.
</p>
<p>Plug at .1 shunts the potentiometer circuit so that the voltage measured
is .1 of the reading taken directly from the scale. Hence, the
readings taken from the setting of the tenths switch and the slide wire
contact must be divided by 10.
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><b>To Balance Galvanometer for Unknown Voltage.</b>--Place plug
in hole 1 (<a href='#Fig_610'>fig. 610</a>) for voltages up to 1.6, and in hole .1 for voltages up
to .16. Rotate the tenths switch until a condition of balance is obtained
exactly or approximately. To secure an exact balance, rotate the contact
on the extended wire. The unknown voltage can now be read
directly from the position of the tenths switch and the extended wire
contact if plug be at 1, or by dividing by 10 if plug be at .1.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_533">[533]</a></span>
EXAMPLE.--A balance was obtained with the tenths switch at 1.3, the extended wire contact
at 176 and the plug at 1. The voltage under test, therefore, is 1.3176. If the plug at .1
had been used, the same reading would have indicated .13176.
</p>
<p>To ascertain if the current in the potentiometer circuit has altered
during a measurement, it is only necessary to plug in at 1, place the double
throw switch on STD. CELL and close the galvanometer key. No
deflection indicates that the current has not changed. If the galvanometer
deflect, the regulating rheostat must again be adjusted until
the galvanometer shows no deflection.
</p>
<p><b>To Measure Voltages from 1.6 to 16.</b>--Pressures up to 16 volts
may be measured by using a greater voltage across the BA posts (<a href="#Fig_615">fig. 615</a>).
For this purpose a battery of about 20 volts should be used.
Insert the large plug at .1 and throw the switch to STD. CELL, then
balance the galvanometer by means of the regulating rheostat. When
the rheostat has been set to secure a balance, insert the large plug at 1,
set the switch on E.M.F. and read the voltage in the usual manner.
Multiply the reading by 10.

to determine the current passing through the shunt, after having obtained a potentiometer
balance it is only necessary to multiply the potentiometer reading by a simple factor. For
instance, in using a .01 ohm standard. It is only necessary to multiply the potentiometer
reading by 100, which gives the current reading in amperes; similarly, a .1 ohm requires
multiplication by 10, and a .001 ohm by 1,000.

<p><b>Care of Potentiometer.</b>--The slide wire, although protected

and dirt with a thin film of oxide. This will tend to increase

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_534">[534]</a></span>
the resistance in this part of the circuit owing to poor
contact. This wire should, therefore, be cleaned occasionally.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To do this, unscrew the stop against which the hood strikes when
turned to read zero; then remove the hood and rub the entire slide wire
vigorously with a soft cloth dipped in vaseline. <i>Do not use emery or sand
paper as this will destroy the uniformity of the slide wire.</i> Clean also the
steel contact which rubs on the wire, as this becomes glazed after much
use. When the potentiometer is not in use, the hood should be screwed
all the way down, and the lid put in place to exclude dust.
</p>
<p>If it be used in a chemical factory, laboratory, or any place where acid
fumes are prevalent, this latter precaution is important, because the
fumes may attack the slide wire.

arrangement of the connections including the lead cables and galvanometer contacts.
Make connections as shown. The clamps must be so fastened at A and C that the contact
resistances will be very small. This contact resistance will figure as an error in the
measurement. If, for instance, the contact resistance were equal to .001 of an ohm, and
the wire were of such a size that .001 of an ohm were equal to the resistance of 20 feet of
the cable, there would be an error of 20 feet in the location of the fault. For this reason
all contact resistances throughout the loop from A to C must be extremely small. The
battery is to be connected to the posts marked Ba., and the post marked Gr. is to be
grounded. It will very frequently happen that the ground is to the cable sheath or some
other conductor. In this case, the binding post Gr. should be grounded to this conductor.
Sufficient battery should be used to give a readable deflection on the galvanometer for a
small movement of the contact on the bridge wire. The fault is located by the usual
Murray formula. If, for instance, the galvanometer show no deflection when the contact
is at 300 on the scale, it would indicate that the fault is at a distance from A equal to .003
of the total length of the loop from A to C. A testing current of five amperes may be
used with this bridge. In cases of necessity, this current may be increased to eight amperes,
but when this current is used it should not be allowed to pass through the bridge for a
longer time than is necessary. It frequently happens that small faults which have a very
high resistance develop in high pressure cables. Such faults are likely to break down and
result in damage and should be located. It is usually impossible to locate these faults
until they have been partially carbonized. This must be done by applying a sufficiently
high voltage between the cable and the sheath (or whatever it is grounded on) to break
down the fault. In order to prevent the breaking down process from resulting in a serious
burn out a high resistance must be placed in the circuit which will prevent an excessive
current, or the circuit must be carefully fused. The former procedure is the better.
</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_535">[535]</a></span>
<b>Location of Faults where the Loop is Composed of
Cables of Different Cross Sections.</b>--Faults in loops of this
character may be located with the same degree of accuracy as
those in loops of a uniform cross section, provided the length
and cross section of each length of cable are known. An example
will illustrate the method:
</p>
<p>In the diagram, <a href="#Fig_617">fig. 617</a>, assume the length of the cable AE
to be 550 yards of 25,000 cir. mil., EF, 500 yards of 40,000 cir.
mil., and FC, 1,050 yards of 30,000 cir. mil. These lengths
must be reduced by calculation to equivalent lengths of one

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_536">[536]</a></span>
size, and for this purpose it is best to select the largest size.
The results of this calculation are as follows:
</p>

<div style="margin-left:5%;">
&nbsp;&nbsp;550 yds. of 25,000 cir. mil. = &nbsp;&nbsp;880 yds. of 40,000 cir. mil.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;500&nbsp;&nbsp;"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"&nbsp;&nbsp; 40,000&nbsp;&nbsp;"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  = &nbsp;&nbsp;500&nbsp;&nbsp;"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"&nbsp;&nbsp; 40,000&nbsp;&nbsp;"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
1,050&nbsp;"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"&nbsp;&nbsp; 30,000&nbsp;&nbsp;"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  = 1,400&nbsp;"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"&nbsp;&nbsp; 40,000&nbsp;&nbsp;"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
</div>
<p>This makes the total resistance of the loop equivalent to
2,780 yards of 40,000 cir. mil. If the contact show a balance
for a reading of 372.5, this indicates that the fault is at a distance
of 372.5/1,000 of 2,780 = 1,035.5 equivalent yards. Of this, 880
are in the stretch A E. Consequently the fault is:
</p>

1,035.5 - 880 = 155.5 yards from E.<br />

AMMETERS, VOLTMETERS AND
WATTMETERS.
</h2>
<p>An ammeter or ampere meter is simply a commercial form of
galvanometer so constructed that the deflection of the needle
indicates directly the strength of current <i>in amperes</i>. A good
ammeter should have a very low resistance so that very little of
the energy of the current will be absorbed; the needle should be
dead beat, and sufficiently sensitive to respond to minute variations
of current.
</p>
<p>According to the principle of operation, ammeters and voltmeters
are classified as:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Moving iron;
</li>
<li>Moving coil;
</li>
<li>Solenoid or plunger;

<li>Electrostatic;
</li>
<li>Astatic;
</li>
<li>Inclined coil;

<li>Fixed and movable coil.

<p><b>Ques. Describe the moving iron type instrument.</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. The arrangement of the working parts are shown in
<a href="#Fig_620">fig. 620</a>. A soft iron needle N, is pivoted inside of a coil C, and
is held out of line with the axis of the coil by means of a permanent
magnet M, when the instrument is idle. In this position, a
pointer P, which is attached to the needle, stands at the zero
mark of the scale S. If a current be passed through the coil,
magnetic lines of force are set up in its center, which tend to pull
the needle into line with them, and therefore with the axis of the
coil. This pull is resisted by the permanent magnet M, and the
amount of deflection of the needle from the zero position depends
upon the strength of the current or the voltage according as the
coil is wound to indicate amperes or volts.

</p>
</div>
<p><b>Ques. Describe a moving coil instrument.</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. This type of instrument is shown in <a href="#Fig_621">fig. 621</a>. It consists
of a moving coil C, to which is attached the pointer, and which is
pivoted between the poles of a permanent magnet M. The coil
moves between these poles and a fixed soft iron core K, and is
held in the normal position by two spiral springs A, above and
below the core. The springs also serve to make electrical connection
with the coil C.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When a current passes through the coil, magnetic lines are set up in
it which are at an angle to those passing from one pole of the permanent
magnet to the other. The lines of force, which formerly passed from
one pole of the magnet to the other by straight lines or by short curved
ones, are "stretched" on account of the field produced by the current
in the coil, and, in trying to shorten themselves, tend to twist the coil
through an angle. This tendency to move is resisted by the two spiral
springs, hence the coil moves until equilibrium is established between
the two opposing forces.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The amount of deflection of the pointer depends, either
upon the current strength, or the voltage according to the
winding of the coil.

metal base plate. The permanent field magnet is
made of a single piece of magnet steel, and the pole
pieces are of soft steel, permanently secured to the magnet
in order that the distribution of the magnetic flux will not be
changed by removal and replacement of the pole piece. Accordingly
the moving mechanism is mounted separately from the field, so that it can be readily lifted from the field without
removing the pole pieces. The function of the core is to secure a uniform field. The moving coil is wound upon
a form of aluminum, which serves the purpose of damping by the generation of eddy currents. The winding of the
coil is of fine copper wire, to which current is conveyed by means of the controlling springs and which, in the case of
a voltmeter, is connected in series with a resistance, and in the case of an ammeter, across the terminals of a shunt.
</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_541">[541]</a></span>
<b>Ques. How does the winding differ in ammeters and
voltmeters?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. An ammeter coil consists of a few turns of heavy wire
(when designed to carry the full current), while a voltmeter coil
is wound with many turns of fine wire. Thus, the ammeter is of
low resistance, and the voltmeter of high resistance.

<b>Ques. Why is a high resistance coil used with a voltmeter?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. As actually constructed, most voltmeters are simply
special forms of ammeter. From Ohm's law, the current through
a given circuit equals the pressure at its terminals divided by its
resistance. Hence, if a high resistance be connected in series
with a sensitive ammeter that will measure very small currents,
then the current passing through the circuit is directly proportional
to the voltage at its terminals, and the instrument may be calibrated
to read volts.

such that all the current passes through the instrument, it is connected as in <a href="#Fig_625">fig. 625</a>, but
where the instrument is designed to take only a fraction of the current, it is connected
across a shunt, as in <a href="#Fig_626">fig. 626</a>, a definite proportion of the current passing through the
instrument and the remainder through the shunt.
</p>
</div>
<p><b>Ques. Into what two classes may ammeters be divided?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. They are classed as series or shunt according to the way
they are designed to be connected with the circuit.
</p>
<p><b>Ques. What determines the mode of connecting ammeters?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. When the wire of the ammeter coil is large enough to
carry the whole current, it is connected in the circuit <i>in series</i>
as shown in <a href="#Fig_625">fig. 625</a>. If, however, the wire be small, the instrument
is connected <i>in parallel</i> with a shunt of low resistance, so
that it only carries a small part of the current, as in <a href="#Fig_626">fig. 626</a>.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_543">[543]</a></span>
For circuits which carry large currents, the shunt connection is always
used, because otherwise the coil of the ammeter would have to be very
heavy and the instrument correspondingly bulky.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Ques. How are shunt ammeters arranged to correctly
measure the current?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. The coil is arranged so that a definite proportion of the
whole current passes through it. A large conductor of low resistance
is connected directly between the two terminals or binding
posts of the instrument; the coil is connected as a shunt
around a definite part of this main conductor; then, since the
two are connected in parallel and each branch has a definite
resistance, the current divides between the two branches directly
in proportion to their relative conductivities, or inversely according
to their resistances. The coil, therefore, takes a definite
part of the whole current, and the force moving it and its
pointer away from the zero position is directly proportional to
the whole current. Hence, by providing a proper scale, the value
of the entire current will be indicated.

</div>
<p><b>Ques. What is the difference between a voltmeter and
an ammeter?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. A voltmeter measures pressure, while an ammeter
measures current. As actually constructed, most voltmeters
are simply special forms of ammeter.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If a high resistance be connected in series with a sensitive ammeter
that will measure very small currents, then the current passing through
the circuit is directly proportional to the pressure or voltage at its
terminals and the instrument may be calibrated to read volts.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Ques. Explain the term "calibrate."</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. To calibrate a measuring instrument is to determine
the variations in its readings by making special measurements,
or by comparison with a <i>standard</i>.

instruments are direct reading and dead beat. Although the scales have practically uniform
divisions, it is not assumed in the calibration that they are uniform, and the scales are not
printed or engraved. The method of calibration consists in laying out each large division
of the scale by comparing the instrument with a standard, and then inking in the division
lines so found. The smaller divisions between the large ones are then equally spaced and
marked by a mechanical method.

<b>Ques. Describe a solenoid or plunger ammeter</b>.
</p>
<p>Ans. This type consists of a "plunger" or soft iron core
arranged to enter a solenoid. Current being passed through the
wire of the solenoid causes the core to be more or less attracted
against a restraining force of gravity or springs. A pivoted
pointer attached to the core indicates the current value on a
graduated dial as shown in <a href="#Fig_633">fig. 633</a>.
</p>
<p><b>Ques. What are the objections to plunger instruments?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. They are not reliable for small readings, and are readily
affected by magnetic fields.
</p>

  />
<p class="caption"><a id="Fig_633"></a><span class="smcap">Fig</span>. 633.--Plunger type instrument. The current to be measured passes through the solenoid,
producing a magnetic effect on the soft iron plunger which tends to draw it into the coil,
and thus cause the pointer to move over the graduated scale. The distance the rod
moves depends on the value of the restraining force (which may be springs or gravity),
the coil winding, and strength of current. The winding consists of a few turns of heavy
wire for an ammeter, and a large number of turns of fine wire when constructed as a voltmeter.
Since the iron has a certain amount of residual magnetism, the deflection with
smaller following large currents is more than would be produced by the same current
following a smaller one. The instrument therefore is less reliable than the usual types.
</p>
</div>
<p><b>Ques. Describe a magnetic vane instrument.</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. It consists of a small piece of soft iron or <i>vane</i> mounted
on a shaft that is pivoted a little off the center of a coil as shown
in <a href="#Fig_634">fig. 634</a>. The principle upon which the instrument works is

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_547">[547]</a></span>
that a piece of soft iron placed in a magnetic field and free to
move will move into such position as to conduct the maximum
number of lines of force. The current to be measured is passed
around the coil producing a magnetic field through the center
of the coil. The magnetic field inside the coil is strongest near
the inner edge, hence, the vane will move against the restraining
force of a spring so that the distance between it and the inner
edge of the coil will be as small as possible. A pointer, attached
to the vane shaft moves over a graduated dial.

<p><b>Ques. Describe an inclined coil instrument.</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. As shown in <a href="#Fig_635">fig. 635</a>, a coil carrying the current, is
mounted at an angle to a shaft to which is attached a pointer.
A bundle of iron strips is mounted on the shaft. A spring restrains
the shaft and holds the pointer at the zero position when
no current is flowing. When a current is passed through the coil,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_548">[548]</a></span>
the iron tends to take up a position with its longest sides parallel
to the lines of force, which results in the shaft being rotated and
the pointer moved on the dial, the amount of movement depending
upon the strength of the current in the coil.

The voltmeters and wattmeters are constructed on the dynamometer principle and the
ammeters, on the magnetic vane principle. The voltmeters and wattmeters are provided
with a contact key which may be locked in position, enabling the instruments to be left
constantly in circuit. The movements of the pointer are damped by means of an air vane;
there is also a friction damping device operated by a small button to check excessive
oscillations of the pointer. The inclined coil instruments are so designed that the torque
is sufficiently high to insure the pointer assuming a definite position with each change in
current value.

</div>
<p><b>Ques. What is the principle of the hot wire instrument?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. Its action depends upon the heating of a conductor by
the current flowing through it, causing it to expand and move an
index needle or pointer, the movements of which, by calibration,
are made to correspond to the pressure differences producing
the actuating currents.
</p>
<p><b>Ques. What are the characteristics of hot wire instruments?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. Voltmeters of this type are not affected by magnetic
fields, and as their self-induction is small, they can be used on

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_549">[549]</a></span>
either direct or alternating currents; but they possess certain
serious defects: they consume more current than the other types;
cannot be constructed for small readings; are liable to burn out
on accidental overloads; and are somewhat vague in the readings
near the zero point and are sometimes inaccurate in the upper
part of the scale.
</p>
<p><b>Ques. Describe the construction and operation of the
Whitney hot wire instruments.</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. As shown in <a href="#Fig_638">fig. 638</a>, a wire AX, of non-oxidizable metal,
of high resistance and low temperature coefficient, passes over a
pulley B mounted on the shaft C. The ends of the wire are
attached to the plate E at its ends F and G, the wire being insulated
from the plate at G. A spring H holds the wire in tension
and takes up the slack due to the expansion caused by the heating
of the wire when a current passes through it. The current

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_550">[550]</a></span>
flows only in the portion of the wire marked A, between the plate
E and the pulley B up to the point K where the connection is
shown. When a current flows through the wire A, the spring
takes up the slack, pulls A around B, and causes B to rotate upon
its shaft C. It is clear, that a pointer attached to C, would indicate
on a scale the movement of B and C, but as this movement
is very slight, a magnifying device will be required. This device
consists of a forked rod L, rigidly attached to the shaft C, and
carrying at its lower end a silk fibre fastened to the fork and passing
around a pulley M, to which a pointer N is attached. For direct
current measurements only an electromagnetic system is used.

<p class="caption"><a id="Fig_638"></a><span class="smcap">Fig</span>. 638.--Diagram showing principle and construction of the Whitney hot wire instruments.
The action of instruments of this type depends on the heating of a wire by the passage of
a current causing the wire to lengthen. This elongation is magnified by suitable mechanism
and transmitted to the pointer of the instrument.
</p>
</div>
<p><b>Ques. What is the principle of electrostatic instruments?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. The action of these instruments depends upon the fact
that two conductors attract one another when any difference of

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_551">[551]</a></span>
electric pressure exists between them. If one be delicately suspended
so as to be free to move, it will approach the other.

pressures up to 200,000 volts. The instrument, as illustrated, consists of fixed and movable
vanes with terminals connecting with each. These vanes which act as condensers take
charges proportional to the potential difference between them, resulting in a certain attraction
which tends to rotate the movable disc against the restraining force of gravity. In
the figure <i>aa</i> and <i>b</i> are two fixed vanes and <i>c</i> a movable vane, carrying a pointer and having
a proper weight at its lower end.
</p>
</div>
<p><b>Ques. Describe the Kelvin electrostatic voltmeter.</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. A simple form consists, as shown in <a href="#Fig_639">fig. 639</a>, of a metal
case containing a pair of highly insulated plates, between which
a delicately mounted paddle shaped needle is free to move. When
the needle is connected to one side of a circuit and the stationary
plates to the other side, the needle is attracted and moves between
them as indicated by the pointer. Adjusting screws at the
lower end of the needle allow it to be balanced so that its center
of gravity is somewhat below the center of suspension. Gravity
then is the restraining force.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_552">[552]</a></span>
The range of the instrument may be changed by hanging different
weights upon the needle. By increasing the number of blades the instrument
can be made to measure as low as 30 volts. The form having
two stationary blades and one movable blade is suitable for measuring
from 200 to 20,000 volts. The quadrant electrometer or laboratory form
will measure a fraction of a volt.

<p class="caption"><a id="Fig_640"></a><span class="smcap">Fig</span>. 640.--Thompson astatic instrument without cover. When current passes through the
coils of the moving element, the lines of force parallel to the shaft produce a torque which
tends to turn the shaft and cause the needle to travel across the scale. This action is, of
course, opposed by the magnetic field at right angles to the shaft acting on the two pieces
of magnetic metal. These astatic instruments have no controlling springs. The two small
silver spirals which conduct the current to and from the armature are made of untempered
silver and exert no force as springs. The actuating and restraining forces are dependent
upon the same electromagnets. The damping effect in these instruments is produced by
an aluminum disc moving in a magnetic field, and is proportional to the square of the magnet
strength.
</p>
</div>
<p><b>Ques. Explain the construction and principle of the
Thompson astatic instruments.</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. The fields of these instruments are electromagnets
wound for any specified voltage and provided with binding posts
separate from the current posts of the instrument. The moving
coils are mounted upon an aluminum disc and are located in a
magnetic field which is parallel to the shaft and astatically
arranged. Two small pieces of magnetic metal are rigidly

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_553">[553]</a></span>
mounted on the shaft and the astatic components of the magnetic
field, which are perpendicular to the shaft, tend to keep the pieces
of magnetic metal in their initial positions. When current passes
through the coils of the moving element, the lines of force
parallel to the shaft produce a torque which tends to turn the
shaft and cause the needle to travel across the scale. This action
is, of course, opposed by the magnetic field at right angles to the
shaft acting on the two pieces of magnetic metal. There are thus
no restraining springs, current being conveyed to the moving
coil by torsionless spirals of silver wire. Thompson astatic
instruments can be provided with polarity indicators, a red
disc showing on the scale card where the poles are reversed.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_554">[554]</a></span>
The effect of external fields is eliminated by the astatic
arrangement of the fields and the moving parts. A field which
tends to increase the torque on one side of the armature diminishes
it to a corresponding degree on the other side. The
damping effect in these instruments is produced by an aluminum
disc moving in a magnetic field.

readings of voltmeters, and consists of resistance coils placed in a portable case. A multiplier
is connected in series with the voltmeter and must be adjusted for the instrument
with which it is to be used, because the resistance coil must be a multiple of the voltmeter
resistance. For instance, a multiplier with a value of 10, used with a 6 volt voltmeter or
521 ohms would measure about 5,215 ohms; one with a value of 40, would equal about
20,860 ohms. The multiplier 10 would give a total scale value of 60, and the multiplier
40, a total scale value of 240 volts to the 6 volt instrument. A multiplier is of considerable
value in that it does away with the necessity of having a number of voltmeters of
different ranges. The instrument here illustrated has a range of 150 volts.
</p>
</div>
<p><b>Ques. What are multipliers?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. These are extra resistance coils which are connected in
series with a voltmeter for increasing its capacity or readings.
They are put up in portable boxes, and must be adjusted for
each particular voltmeter as the resistance of a multiplier coil
must be a multiple of the resistance of the voltmeter itself.

<p><b>Ques. Describe the Siemens' electro-dynamometer.</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. The essential parts are shown in <a href="#Fig_646">fig. 646</a>. The fixed
coil A, composed of a number of turns of wire is fastened to a
vertical support, and surrounded by the movable coil B of a few
turns, or often of only one turn. The movable coil is suspended
by a thread and a spiral spring C, below the dials which are
fastened at one end to the movable coil and at the other end to a
milled headed screw D, which can be turned so as to place the
planes of the coil at right angles to each other, and to apply
torsion to the spring to oppose the deflection of the movable coil
for this position when a current is passed through the coils. The

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_556">[556]</a></span>
ends of the movable coil dip into two cups of mercury E, E',
located one above the other and along the axis of the coils so
as to bring the two in series when connected to an external
circuit. The arrows show the direction of current through the
two coils. An index pointer F is attached to the movable coil.
The upper end of this pointer is bent at a right angle, so that it
swings over the dial between two stop pins G, G', and rests
directly over the zero line when the planes of the coils are at
right angles to each other. A pointer H is attached to the torsion
screw D, and sweeps over the scale of the dial. The spring is the

ampere demand of appreciable duration in any electrical circuit. It may be used on either

A liquid is hermetically sealed in a glass vessel consisting of two bulbs connected by a
"U" tube, and a central tube called the "index" tube, connected to the upper end of the
right hand side of the "U." Around the left hand or heating bulb, is placed a band of
resistance metal, through which the current to be measured is passed, or a definite shunted
portion of it. The heating effect of the current increases the temperature of the left hand
bulb, causing the air to expand which forces the liquid up the right hand side of the "U"
tube and into the index tube, where it remains until the indicator is reset. The height of
the liquid in the index tube as shown by the scale, indicates the maximum current which
has passed through the indicator. It is the difference in temperature of the air in the two
bulbs which causes the flow of the liquid. Any change in external temperature causes
equal effect in both bulbs and therefore does not affect the reading.

<p class="caption"><a id="Fig_651"></a><a id="Fig_652"></a><span class="smcap">Figs</span>. 651 and 652.--Weston illuminated dial station voltmeter and ammeter. The voltmeter
has two indices, a pointed index for close readings and an index called the <i>normal index</i>,
which enables a slight deviation from the normal voltage to be seen from a long distance.
The "normal index" is inside the case and terminates in a circular disc of blackened aluminum.
The disc is adjusted from the outside of the case by hand, by means of the knurled
knob seen on the front of the case, so that it is directly below the point of normal voltage.
When the indicating index reaches the point of normal voltage, the disc of the normal
index appears in the center of the circular opening of the indicating index, a narrow ring
of white being visible, encircling the disc of the normal index. The ammeter depends for
its operation upon the fall of potential between two points of the circuit carrying the main
current, and requires a difference of only about .05 volt to give a full scale deflection. When
a maximum deflection is secured, the current passing through the instrument is never more
than .07 ampere irrespective of the total capacity of the instrument. A separate shunt is
used which is placed at the back of the switchboard. In many cases, a special shunt can
be dispensed with and a short section of the mains on the switchboard, or the mains leading
from the dynamo, can be used instead. On the basis of one square inch cross section
per 1,000 amperes, a length of about 5 feet of copper conductor would be required as a
shunt, in which case however, this section of the conductor must be adjusted with
precision.

<p><b>Ques. Explain the operation of the Siemen's electrodynamometer.</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. In <a href="#Fig_646">fig. 646</a>, when a current is passed through both coils,
the movable coil is deflected against a stop pin, then the screw
D is turned in a direction to oppose the action of the current until
the deflection has been overcome and the coil brought back to
its original position. The angle through which the pointer of the
torsion screw was turned is directly proportional to the square
root of the angle of torsion. To determine the current strength

<p><b>Ques. How is the electrodynamometer adapted to
measure volts or watts?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. When constructed as a voltmeter, both coils are wound
with a large number of turns of fine wire making the instrument
sensitive to small currents. Then by connecting a high resistance
in series with the instrument it can be connected across the terminals
of a circuit whose voltage is to be measured. When constructed
as a wattmeter, one coil is wound so as to carry the main

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_560">[560]</a></span>
current, and the other made with many turns of fine wire of
high resistance suitable for connecting across the circuit. With
this arrangement, the force between the two coils will be proportional
to the product of amperes by volts, hence, the instrument
will measure watts.

<p><b>Ques. Describe briefly the construction of the
Thompson recording wattmeter.</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. It consists of four elements: 1, a motor causing rotation;
2, a dynamo providing the necessary load or drag; 3, a
registering device, the function of which is to integrate the
instantaneous values of the electrical energy to be measured;
and 4, means of regulation for light and full load.

HOW TO READ A METER<br />
</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="caption"><a id="Fig_655"></a><span class="smcap">Fig</span>. 655.--Recording dials of watt hour meter, illustrating method of reading electric meters. The unit of measurement of
electrical energy is the watt hour. 1,000 watt hours make or equal 1 kilowatt hour. Some electric meters have 4 dials, the
extreme right hand dial of which registers in kilowatt hours, while others have 5 dials, the extreme right hand dial of which
registers in tenths of kilowatt hours. In making out bills to customers the extreme right hand dial of a 5 dial meter is ignored
in order that the "state of meter" shown on bills uniformly requires the addition of 3 ciphers to correctly express the registration
in watt hours. Each division on the right hand dial (ignoring the 5th dial mentioned) denotes 1,000 watt hours or 1
kilowatt hour; on the next dial 10 kilowatt hours, on the next dial 100 kilowatt hours and on the left hand dial 1,000 kilowatt
hours. One complete revolution of any dial causes the hand on the dial immediately to its left to move forward one division.
To take a statement from the meter begin at the left and set down for each dial the lower figure next to each hand, not necessarily
the figure nearer the hand. In the above example the statement is 1,726 kilowatt hours or 1,726,000 watt hours. Subtract
the previous statement to arrive at registration for a given period. Some meters are subject to a multiplying constant
so stated on their face and the registration of such meters must be multiplied by the constant as shown, to determine the
actual consumption of electrical energy. The constant is the measure of the mechanical adjustment in the register of the
meter and is the ratio between the registration of the dial hands and the true consumption. This adjustment is made always
by the manufacturer of the meter and is never changed in service.
</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_562">[562]</a></span>
<b>Ques. What is the action of the motor in the Thompson
watt hour meter?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. It rotates at very slow speed, and since there is no
iron in its fields and armature, it has very little reverse
voltage. Its armature current, therefore, is independent of
the speed of rotation, and is constant for any definite voltage
applied at its terminals.
</p>

<p class="caption"><a id="Fig_656"></a><span class="smcap">Fig</span>. 656.--Interior of Thompson watt hour meter (type C-6) showing armature, small commutator
and gravity brushes. A spherical armature moving within circular field coils is
the construction adopted in this meter. The armature is wound on a very thin paper
shell, stiff enough to withstand the strain due to winding and subsequent handling. The
wire composing the armature is of the smallest gauge consistent with mechanical strength.
The field coils, as before stated, are circular, and are placed as near each other as possible,
one on either side of the armature, with the internal diameter just sufficient to give the
necessary clearance for the rotating element. This construction prevents magnetic leakage.
Ribbon wire is employed for the field coils, thus economizing space and further
carrying out the idea of concentration.
</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>The torque of this motor being proportioned to the product of its
armature and field currents, must vary directly as the energy passing
through its coils. In order then, that the motor shall record correctly it
is necessary only to provide some means for making the speed proportional
to the torque. This is accomplished by applying a load or drag,
the strength of which varies directly as the speed.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_563">[563]</a></span>
<b>Ques. Explain the operation of the Thompson recording
wattmeter.</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. There being no iron in either field or armature of the
motor element, no considerations of saturation are involved.
The torque or pull of the armature is dependent upon the product
of the field and armature strength. The strength of the field--there
being no iron--varies directly with the current in the field.
Thus the strength of the field with 10 amperes flowing to the load
is exactly twice the strength of the field with 5 amperes flowing
to the load. The strength of the armature is dependent on the
voltage of the system to which it is connected, the armature
element of the meter being practically a voltmeter. There is,
therefore, a torque or pull varying directly with the strength of
the armature multiplied by the strength of the field, or, in other
words, varying directly with the watt load, and except in so far
as influenced by friction, the speed of rotation varies directly
with the torque or pull. The currents generated in the disc
armature consist of eddy currents, which circulate within the
mass of the disc.
</p>
<p><b>Installation of Wattmeters.</b>--The various types of wattmeter
differ so widely either in mechanical details, or operating
principles, that it is customary for manufacturers to furnish
detailed instructions for the installation of their meters. Such
instructions should be carefully followed in all cases, but the
following will be found generally applicable to all types of
motor meter:
</p>
<ol>
<li>After unpacking the meter, and before opening the case or cover,
clean the latter carefully to remove all adhering particles of dust
and excelsior.
</li>
<li>The proper location for the meter should be one where there is no
vibration. When this location has been selected, nail or screw upon
the walls, a board somewhat larger than the dimensions of the back
of the meter, and upon this board hang the meter by the top hanger.
</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_564">[564]</a></span>
After hanging the meter, open or remove the case or cover, and if
necessary, put the mechanism in order according to instructions
furnished by the manufacturer.
</li>
<li>In order to operate satisfactorily, the meter should hang plumb, so
that the spindle of the revolving element will be vertical, and the
horizontal planes through the armature and retarding disc will be
level. Many complaints relative to meters being slow on light loads,
are invariably due to the fact that the meters have been installed
out of plumb<a id="FNanchor_B"></a><a href="#Footnote_B" class="fnanchor"><sup>B</sup></a>.
</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_567">[567]</a></span>
In making the circuit connections, be very careful that the <i>positive</i>
lead or wire is placed in the <i>positive</i> binding post of the meter. This
precaution is essential for insuring an accurate and sensitive measurement
on small loads.
</li>
<li>When a meter of the commutated motor type sparks at the brushes
at starting, it is an indication that the commutator is dusty. Clean
it with a piece of closely woven cotton tape 1/4-inch in width.
</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_568">[568]</a></span>
Meters should never be allowed to remain with their covers off, in
the testing room, station, or any other place. In order to get the best
service, and to give them long life they must be kept clean.
</li>
</ol>
<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_B"></a><a href="#FNanchor_B"><span class="fnlabel">[B]</span></a>
NOTE.--The most practical and accurate method of plumbing a meter is to level it by
means of a small brass weight placed upon the retarding disc. Place the weight upon the front
or back upper surface of the disc, close to the edge. If the disc and weight rotate toward the
right, move the bottom of the meter in the same direction so as to raise the disc on the right.
When the disc is level, the weight and disc will remain stationary when the weight is placed
on either the front or the back of the disc. Next, place the weight on the disc close to the edge
on either side. If the disc rotate towards the front, swing the bottom of the meter away from
the wall or board until the disc remains stationary when the weight is placed upon it on either
side. If the disc rotate toward the back, raise it up on that side by bringing the top of the
meter away from the wall or board. It is possible that the second levelling operation will alter
the position of the disc obtained by the first operation, therefore, the first should be repeated,
and after that the second also, until the disc remains stationary when the weight is placed at
any point upon its surface. This method of levelling is more reliable than any method in
which a spirit level is employed.

<p class="caption"><a id="Fig_658"></a><span class="smcap">Fig</span>. 658.--Specimen record from General Electric recording ammeter. The record is made on a band of specially prepared paper
four inches wide and sixty feet in length. On this paper are ruled lines corresponding to time, and the instrument calibration.
The lines ruled across the paper represent time; those ruled lengthwise represent volts, amperes, or watts, depending upon
the instrument construction. This form of paper has the advantage of permitting the use of time divisions of equal length
throughout the entire range of the recording pen. The recording pen is attached to the moving element in such a manner
that its motion is transmitted in a straight line parallel to the time division on the chart. As the paper is unwound and passed
under the recording pen, it is paid into a space at the bottom of the instrument case. To assist in removing paper, the
instrument is provided with a stripper, which enables the paper to be torn off evenly and without damage. The paper feeding
mechanism is simple. By means of suitable gearing, the clock drives a drum having peg teeth which engage the holes located
near the edge of the paper. These teeth not only feed the paper under the recording pen, but also give it a definite and
accurate position along the axis of the drum. The feeding drum is driven by a friction clutch.

<p class="caption"><a id="Fig_659"></a><span class="smcap">Fig</span>. 659.--Westinghouse type CW-6 watt hour meter with cover off. This meter is of the
commutator type without iron in the magnetic circuit. The spherical armature is closely
surrounded by circular field coils which provide the shortest magnetic path and smallest
magnetic leakage, thus securing high torque with small consumption of energy. The
armature winding is wound on a hollow sphere of prepared paper which is moulded in
corrugated form to secure strength. Uniform brush tension is maintained by gravity.
Each brush consists of two small round wires placed side by side and held against the commutator
by a small counterweight whose distance from the fulcrum is adjustable. The
current winding consists of two flat coils of strap copper, one clamped rigidly on either side
of the central mounting frame which supports the armature bearings. These coils are connected
either in series or parallel, depending on the capacity. In three wire meters one of
the coils is connected in series with each side of the line. The retarding element consists
of a light aluminum disc rotating between two pairs of permanent magnets. The magnets
are prepared by a special aging process to insure permanence. Full load adjustment is
made by shifting the position of the permanent magnets. Ample light load adjustment or
friction compensation is provided by means of the movable coil, which can be shifted horizontally
or radially on loosening one screw. The meter registers directly in kilowatt hours.

watt hour meter. The actuating
force is a large flat coil spring
enclosed in a barrel or drum to which
its outside end is attached. The
operating knob winds this main spring
by turning the drum. The spring
has many turns and as the operation
of the device never equals one whole
turn, the spring always exerts a
practically constant force. The rate
device consists of a small train of
gears secured to the front of the
frame directly back of the register.
Each device is marked with the price
per kw-hr. for which it should be
used. The switch is of the double
pole double break type with leaf
contacts. The coin receptacles are
placed at the back of the meter. To
make an advance payment, the winding
knob is turned so that the arrow
points upward. A quarter dollar is
then inserted in the slot and the knob
turned to the right, the coin serving
as a key which operates the mechanism
within the device, turning the
registering wheel and placing the coin
to the credit of the customer. If
the circuit be open when the coin
is deposited the same motion of the
knob which moves the registering
mechanism closes the circuit switch
contained within the case. The dial
contains a scale marked in plain
figures over which a pointer passes indicating the number of coins remaining to the credit
of the depositor. When the first coin is deposited and the knob turned closing the main
switch, the pointer rests opposite the first division on the scale. If a second coin be deposited
before the current purchased with the first coin has been consumed, a second
motion of the knob will bring the pointer opposite the second division on the scale.
Twelve coins can thus be deposited consecutively, after which the slot is automatically
closed and further prepayment cannot be made until the value of one or more coins has
been consumed. Whenever energy to the value of one coin has been delivered through
the meter, the escapement is mechanically released turning the pointer back one division.
This process continues until all the energy has been delivered for which payment has
been made. Thus the depositor can ascertain at any time how much energy can be obtained
without further payment. When all energy has been delivered, the circuit switch is opened
so that no more current can be obtained until one or more coins have been deposited.
The indicating mechanism shows only the number of coins which stand to the credit of
the customer, but, by consulting the meter dial, one can determine what fractional part
of the prepayment next to be cancelled remains to the credit of the customer. A coin
or washer larger than the coin for which the device is designed cannot be introduced into
the receiving slot and a smaller one will not operate the device.

</div>
<p><b>How to test a meter.</b>--A simple test for ascertaining whether
a customer's meter is fast or slow<a id="FNanchor_C"></a><a href="#Footnote_C" class="fnanchor"><sup>C</sup></a>, may be applied as follows:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Turn off the lamps and other power consuming devices in the house
and then note the reading of the meter dial and the exact time of day;
</li>
<li>Turn on as quickly as possible about one-tenth of all the lamps in
the house and allow them to burn for about two hours;
</li>
<li>At the end of two hours, turn off the lamps as quickly as possible
and note the reading of the meter dial.
</li>
</ol>
<p>The difference between the first and second readings of the dial will be
the indicated consumption of two hours, and if this be greater than the
amount of power that ought to be consumed by the number of lamps
turned on, the meter is fast, but if it be less, the meter is slow.
</p>
<p>The best results obtained by this method are only approximations,
however, on account of the variations in the watts consumed by the
different makes of lamp, the uncertainty as to the actual voltage on
the line at the time of the test, and the lack of knowledge as to the age
of the lamps. Therefore, if the meter test within five per cent., or do
not record more nor less than one-twentieth of the assumed lamp consumption
it is safe to assume that the meter is correct as the result of
the test is not likely to be any closer to the truth.
</p>

NOTE.--A meter operates under more varied and exacting conditions than almost any
other piece of apparatus. It is frequently subjected to vibration, moisture and extremes of
temperature; it must register accurately on varying voltages and various wave forms; it must
operate for many months without any supervision or attention whatever; and, in spite of all
these conditions, it is expected to register with accuracy from a few per cent. of its rated capacity
to a 50 per cent. overload. As a meter is a type of machine, its natural tendency is to run slow;
but occasionally, through accident, a meter may run fast. When a meter runs fast the consumer
is paying a higher rate per kilowatt hour than his contract calls for. He is being discriminated
against. The periodic testing of meters is therefore a necessity and is an indication
of the honesty of intention of the manager toward the customers of his company. Meters
controlling a very large amount of revenue may be tested as often as once a month, while the
ordinary run of meters should be tested at least once a year, once in eighteen months, or once in
two years, the period varying with different companies, different types and different civic
requirements. Commutator type meters, having comparatively heavy moving elements with
consequent rapid increase in friction due to wear on the jewel and bearings, and a commutator
also increasing in friction with age, must have frequent and expert attention to insure their
accuracy under all conditions.

<p class="caption"><a id="Fig_662"></a><span class="smcap">Fig</span>. 662.--Interior view of Columbia watt hour meter (type D), showing construction and
principal parts and connections. The armature winding consists of three coils approximately
circular in shape. The coils are form wound, interlocked with one another and with
the light impregnated fibre disc which serves as a spacer for them. The aluminum damper
disc has the conventional anti-creep provision in the shape of the three small soft iron
plugs, mounted close to the central staff, which the illustration shows. These in their
revolution come successively within the influence of an adjustable iron screw which is
magnetized by an extension from one of the damper magnets. The angular relationship
of the armature windings and of the three iron plugs is such that at the time that the
armature is exerting a maximum torque the magnetized screw is exerting the maximum
pull to hold back a given plug and conversely when the armature pull is a minimum
the magnetic screw is attracting a plug with the maximum effort to cause ahead rotation.
The irregularities of torque are in this way smoothed out. The commutator has three
segments and is made of chemically pure silver. Each brush is formed of a length of
phosphor bronze wire bent like a hair pin and secured at its "U" end to a brass sleeve,
which in turn is secured to an insulated stud by a set screw. An extension on the sleeve
carries a micrometer screw brush adjustment. The main speed adjustment is secured by
providing a soft iron bridge plate, bridging over the extremities of each magnet end and
adjustable, by means of a set screw and lock nut, to any desired distance therefrom. This
gives a regular micrometer means of varying the effective magnet strength. Interposed
between the series coil and the permanent magnets is a heavy soft iron shield to guard the
magnets against disturbance by short circuiting. Light load adjustment is obtained by
providing in the coil circuit a series of small resistance spools, equipped with pin terminals,
to which connection can be selectively made by means of a split bushing terminal on a
flexible cord. This series of spools is strung on a metal arbor located within the case.

motion in the latter. It also embodies the other two necessary watt hour meter
elements required for the speed control and registration of the revolutions of the armature,
these being embodied in the drag magnet and disc, and the meter register respectively.
The motion of the armature is converted into continuous rotation by the aid of a commutator
and brushes, the commutator being connected to the armature coils and carried

<b>Waste of Electricity in Lighting.</b>--In large residences where
a good many servants are employed or in any place where the
power consumed is not directly under the supervision of the person
who must pay the bills, a great deal of waste usually occurs.
</p>
<p>If the meter be read before retiring, the reading in the morning will
show how much energy was consumed during the night, which will
show in turn how many lamps were burning all night.
</p>
<p>A great deal of light can be saved by placing the lamps so that they
will throw the light where it is needed and by placing small lamps such
as 8 candle power and 4 candle power in places where not much light is
needed, such as bathrooms, halls, cellars, etc.
</p>
<p>When the lamps get old and dim they should be replaced with new
ones, as it costs about the same to burn an old lamp as a new one. An
old 16 candle power lamp which is very dim will give only about 8
candle power and use about as much current as is required for a new
16 candle power. If the dim light be light enough, it should be replaced
by an 8 candle power lamp, which will not consume as much power
as the old 16 candle power.

<p><b>Before Starting a Dynamo or Motor.</b>--When the machine
has been securely fixed, it should be carefully examined to see

made as follows:
</p>
<ol>
<li>The field magnet circuit should first be inspected to see that
none of the wires or connections have broken or have become
loose, and that the coils are correctly connected;
</li>
<li>The caps of the bearings should be taken off, and these
and the journals carefully cleaned of all grit and dirt.  They
should then be oiled, and the caps replaced and screwed up
by hand only;
</li>
<li>The gaps between the outer surface of the armature and
the polar faces should be examined in order to ascertain whether
any foreign body, such as a small screw or nail has lodged therein.
If such be the case, it should be carefully removed with a bit of
wire;
</li>
<li>The guard plates protecting the armature windings should
be removed, and the windings carefully inspected by slowly
rotating the armature, to see that they are not damaged, and
that the insulation is perfect. The armature should then be
finally rotated by hand to see that it revolves freely, and that
the bearings are securely fixed;
</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_574">[574]</a></span>
The commutator should be examined to see that it is not
damaged in any way through one or more of the segments being
knocked in, or the lugs being forced into contact with one
another;

<li>The brush holders and brushes should be inspected to see
that the former work freely on the spindle, and that the hold off

<p><b>Adjusting the Brushes.</b>--The <i>adjustment of the brushes</i>
upon the commutator requires careful attention if sparking is
to be avoided. There are two adjustments to be made:
</p>
<ol>
<li>For pressure;
The brushes must bear against the commutator segments with
sufficient pressure for proper contact.
</li>
<li>For lead.
The brushes must have the proper angular advance (positive or
negative, according as the machine is a dynamo or motor) to prevent
sparking.
</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Ques. At what point on the commutator should the
brushes bear?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. The points upon the commutator at which the tips of
the brushes (carried by opposite arms of the rocker) bear, should

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_575">[575]</a></span>
be, in bipolar dynamos, at opposite extremities of a diameter.
In multipolar dynamos the positions vary with the number of
poles and the nature of the armature winding.
</p>
<p><b>Ques. What provision is made to facilitate the correct
setting of the brushes?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. Setting marks are usually cut in the collar of the
commutator next to the bearing.

<span class="smcap">Figs</span>. 664 and 665.--Diagrams illustrating how to set brushes. Some brush holders require brushes
set <i>with</i> the direction of rotation of the commutator, and others, set <i>against</i> the direction
of rotation. In <a href="#Fig_664">fig. 664</a> is shown a brush holder of the first class, which must always be set
as indicated by the arrow. If set in the opposite direction, trouble will ensue, as an
inspection of the figure will show, because the surface of the commutator and the brush
would form a toggle joint, and the brush would tend to dig into the commutator and
either break itself or bend the brush rigging. In <a href="#Fig_665">fig. 665</a> is shown a brush holder of the
second type. This brush is set against the direction of rotation, but an inspection of the
cut will show that there is, in this case, no tendency for the brush to dig into the commutator
surface. Each type of brush holder, of which there are several, should be adjusted
as recommended by the manufacturer to secure proper working.
</p>
</div>
<p><b>Ques. How are the brushes set by these marks?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. The tips of all the brushes carried by one arm of the
rocker are set in correct line with the commutator segments
marked out by one setting mark, and the tips of the brushes
carried by the other arm or arms are set in correct line with the
segments marked out by the other mark or marks.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If one or more of the brushes in a set be out of line with their setting
mark, it will be necessary to adjust the brushes up to this mark by pushing
them out or drawing them back, as may be required, afterwards

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_576">[576]</a></span>
clamping them in position. When adjusting the brushes, the armature
should always be rotated, so that the setting marks are horizontal. The
rocker can then be rotated into position, and the tips of both sets of
brushes conveniently adjusted to their marks. In those brush holders
provided with an index or pointer for adjusting the brushes, the setting
marks upon the commutator are absent, length of the pointer being so
proportioned that when the tips of the brushes are in line with the extreme
tips of the pointers, the brushes bear upon the correct positions on
the commutator.

is to drill a hole through the carbon so that the cable will just slip through, countersink
the edge of the hole a little, clean the cable thoroughly and pass it through the hole.
Then with any good flux and solder, fill the countersunk part on both sides.
</p>
</div>
<p><b>Ques. What should be done after adjusting the brushes
to their correct positions upon the commutator?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. Their tips or rubbing ends should be examined while
in position to see that they bed accurately on the surface of
the commutator.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In many instances it will be found that this is not the case, the
brushes sometimes bearing upon the point or toe, and sometimes upon
the heel, so that they do not make contact with the commutator throughout
their entire thickness and width. The angle of the rubbing ends
will therefore need to be altered by filing to make them lie flat.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_577">[577]</a></span>
<b>Ques. How is the proper brush contact secured?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. When the brushes do not bed properly they should be
refitted to secure proper contact.
</p>
<p><b>Ques. How is the pressure adjustment made?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. This is effected by regulating the tension of the springs
provided for the purpose upon the brush holders.
</p>
<p><b>Ques. With what pressure should the brushes bear
against the commutator?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. The tension of the springs should be just sufficient to
cause the brushes to make a light yet reliable contact with the
commutator.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The contact must not be too light, otherwise the brushes will vibrate,
and thus cause sparking; nor must it be too heavy, or they will press too
hard upon the commutator, grinding, scoring and wearing away the
latter and themselves to an undesirable extent, and moreover, giving
rise to heating and sparking.
</p>
<p>The correct pressure is attained when the brushes collect the full
current without sparking, while their pressure upon the commutator
is just sufficient to overcome ordinary vibration due to the rotation of
the commutator.

<span class="smcap">Figs</span>. 667 to 669.--Method of winding cables with marlin. When connecting the feeders and
dynamo and service leads to a switchboard, the wires are often <i>served</i> with marlin. By
serving is meant to tightly wrap the wires of each set together with marlin. A tool for
serving may be made as in <a href="#Fig_667">fig. 667</a>, using a piece of oak 2 ins. wide, 7/8 in. thick and 14 ins.
long, having four holes drilled through it, as shown. The marlin is passed through the
holes, commencing at the hole nearest the handle, the object being to cause a strain on
the marlin at the point where it passes around the wire, so that the marlin may be wrapped
tightly. It is necessary to serve the first four or five inches by hand, pushing the winding
into the conduit as far as possible. This acts as an additional protection to the wires
where they leave the conduit. The serving is continued, as in <a href="#Fig_668">fig. 668</a>, to within four or
five inches of the first lug by means of the serving tool, passing the ball of marlin around
the wires with the serving tool. The wires are then bent in shape, as in <a href="#Fig_669">fig. 669</a>. To serve
the wires properly it is necessary to tie the ends of the wires taut. The wires should be
straightened and run together so as to be parallel, being bound with tape at different
points to keep them so. When the serving is complete the marlin should be thoroughly
painted with a moisture resisting compound. The marlin serving will stiffen the wires
and they can be bent very neatly to avoid touching the bus bars of the board. When
painted the marlin hardens so that it is difficult to bend the wires after the paint has dried.
It then requires a strong pressure to bend them. The marlin acts as an additional insulation
and mechanical protection to the wires, and while no harm would result from the
wires coming in contact with the bars while thus protected, it looks better to bend them so
as to avoid touching the bars.

</div>
<p><b>Direction of Rotation.</b>--This is sometimes a matter of
doubt and often results in considerable trouble. As a general
rule, a dynamo is intended to run in a certain direction; either
right handed or left handed according to whether the armature,
when looked at from the pulley end, revolves with or against
the direction of the hands of a clock. Dynamos are usually
designed to run right handed, but the manufacturers will make
them left handed if so desired.
</p>
<p>It may be necessary to reverse the direction of rotation of a
dynamo, if the driving pulley to which it has to be connected
happen to revolve left handed, or if it be necessary to bring the
loose side of the belt on top of the pulley, or to place the machine

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_579">[579]</a></span>
in a certain position on account of limited space. The direction
of rotation of ordinary series, shunt, or compound bipolar
dynamos may be reversed by simply reversing the brushes
without changing any of the connections, then changing the
point of contact of the brush tips 180°.
</p>
<p>In multipolar dynamos, a similar change, amounting to 90°
for a four pole machine, and 45° for an eight pole machine, will
reverse their direction of rotation. It will be understood that
under these conditions, the original direction of the current and
the polarity of the field magnets will remain unchanged.
</p>
<p>This rule does not apply to arc dynamos and other machines,
which have to be run in a certain direction only, in order to suit
their regulating devices.
</p>
<p>If the direction of current generated by a dynamo be opposite
to that desired, the two leads should be reversed in the terminals,
or the residual magnetism should be reversed by a
current from an outside source.

<span class="smcap">Figs</span>. 671 and 672.--Tinning block for electric soldering tool. It is made with two soft bricks.
One brick is used to support the soldering tool, and the other to contain the tinning
material and to furnish a material which will keep the copper bit bright enough to receive
its coating of "tin." <a href="#Fig_671">Fig. 671</a> represents a section of the tinning brick, which is scooped
out on top as shown by the lower line. Into one end of the hollow in the brick, some
sal-ammoniac is placed to help tin the copper bit. Sal-ammoniac is a natural flux for
copper and aids greatly in keeping the tool well tinned. Next, some melted solder is run
into the hollow of the brick, and lastly enough resin to fill the cavity nearly to the top.
When the tool is not in use, the electricity is switched off and the tool permitted to lie in
the resin. If it be desired to repair the tin coating a little when the tool is in use, the
latter is rubbed on the brick below the layer of solder, and the layer of resin. If the tool
be in very bad condition, it may be pushed into the sal-ammoniac once or twice and then
rubbed in the solder again. It requires but little heat to keep the brick and its contents
ready for use. In fact, the brick is a fair non-conductor of heat and prevents the escape
of heat from one side of the tool. When momentarily not in use, the tool remains in the
solder which becomes melted underneath the layer of resin. When the copper bit
becomes too hot, it will begin to volatilize the resin, thus calling attention to this fact,
whereupon, the electricity should be turned off from the tool.

<b>Ques. How should a dynamo be started?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. A dynamo is usually brought up to speed either by
starting the driving engine, or by connecting the dynamo to a
source of power already in motion. In the first case, it should
be done by a competent engineer, and in the second case by a
person experienced in putting on friction clutches to revolving
shafts, or in slipping on belting to moving pulleys.

each machine is connected to the same bus bar. In starting, if but one machine is to be
used, the dynamo is first brought up to speed and the voltage regulated by means of the
rheostat R and the voltmeter V. The main switch is then thrown in. The connections
for the field are taken off the dynamo leads so that the opening of the main switch will not
open the field circuit and for this reason the field will begin to build up as soon as the
machine is started. When but one of the machines is running, the idle machine is brought
up to speed with the main switch open, and the voltage regulated by means of the rheostat
and voltmeter until the voltages of the machines are the same. Then the main switch is
thrown in and the load on the machines (which is ascertained by the ammeters) is equalized
by means of the rheostats. Should there be any great difference in voltages, the higher one
will run the other as a motor without changing the direction of rotation. The field current
will remain unchanged, and the armature current of the low dynamo will be reversed,
which will cause it to run as a motor in the same direction as it ran as a dynamo. When
dynamos feeding current to motors are to be shut down, the switches on the motors should
first be opened. Otherwise some of the motor fuses will blow. As the voltage goes down
the motors will draw more current to do the work. If a plant be shut down with the
motor switches "in" it will generally be found impossible to start a shunt dynamo, the
low resistance in the mains not allowing enough current to flow around the shunt fields
to energize them.

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_582">[582]</a></span>
<b>Ques. Should the brushes be raised out of contact in
starting?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. The brushes should not be in contact in starting if
there be any danger of reverse rotation, as might happen when
the dynamo is driven by a gas engine. Aside from this, it is
desirable that the brushes be in contact, because they are more
easily and better adjusted, and the voltage will come up slowly,
so that any fault or difficulty will develop gradually and can be
corrected, or the machine stopped before any injury is done.

<p class="caption"><a id="Fig_675"></a><span class="smcap">Fig</span>. 675.--Connections for two compound wound dynamos to run in parallel. The series
fields of the machines are connected together in parallel by means of wire leads or bus bars,
which connect together the brushes from which the series fields are taken. This is known
as the equalizer and is shown by the line running to the middle pole of the dynamo switch.
By tracing out the series circuits it will be seen that current from the upper brush of either
dynamo has two connections to its bus bar. One of these leads through its own field, and
the other, by means of the equalizer bar, through the fields of the other dynamo. As long
as both machines are generating equally there is no difference of pressure between the
brushes of either, but should the voltage of one be lowered, current from the other would
flow through its fields and thereby raise the voltage, and at the same time reduce its
own until both are equal. The equalizer may then be called upon to carry much current,
but to have the machines regulate closely it should be of low resistance. It may also be
run as shown by the dotted lines, but this will leave all the machines alive when any one
is generating. The ammeters should be connected as shown. If they were on the other
side they would come under the influence of the equalizing current and would indicate
wrong, either too high or too low. The equalizer switch should be closed a little before
the main switches are closed.
</p>
</div>
<p><b>Ques. How should a shunt or compound machine be
started?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. All switches controlling the external circuits should be
opened, as the machine excites best when this is the case. If

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_584">[584]</a></span>
the machine be provided with a rheostat or hand regulator and
resistance coils, these latter should all be cut out of circuit, or
short circuited, until the machine excites, when they can be
gradually cut in as the voltage rises.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the machine is giving the correct voltage, as indicated by the
voltmeter or pilot lamp, the machine may be switched into connection
with the external or working circuits.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Ques. In starting a shunt dynamo, should the main
line switch be closed before the machine is up to voltage
or after?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. If the machine be working on the same circuit with
other machines, or with a storage battery, it is, or course, necessary
to make the voltage of the machine equal to that on the
line before connecting it in the circuit. If the machine work
alone, the switch may be closed either before or after the voltage
comes up. The load will be thrown on suddenly if the switch
be closed after the machine has built up its voltage, thus causing
a strain on the belt, and possibly drawing water over the engine
cylinder. On the other hand, if the switch be closed before the
voltage of the machine has come up, the load is picked up gradually,
but the machine may be slow or may even refuse to pick
up at all.
</p>
<p><b>Ques. Why does a shunt machine pick up more slowly
if the main switch be closed first?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. Because the resistance of the main line is so much less
than that of the field that the small initial voltage due to the
residual magnetism causes a much larger current in the armature
than in the shunt field. If this be too large, the cross and back
magnetizing force of the armature weakens the field more than
the initial field current strengthens it, and so the machine
cannot build up.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_585">[585]</a></span>
<b>Ques. If a shunt dynamo will not pick up, what is likely
to be the trouble?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. The speed may be too slow; the resistance of the
external circuit may be too small; the brushes may not be
in proper position; some of the electrical connections in the
dynamo may be loose, broken or improperly made; the field
may have lost its residual magnetism.

lower candle power. When the switch S is closed, if the two lines be clear, the brilliancy
of the lamps will not be affected, but if there be a ground on the positive side, one lamp
will burn brighter, the brightness depending on the resistance of the ground. If there

<p><b>Ques. What is the indication that the connections

coils may be improperly connected.

shunt field leads, and then starting up the machine. As soon as the voltmeter registers
any voltage, the dynamo may be stopped and the field leads restored to their original
position, when it will be found that the residual magnetism in the pole pieces will usually
bring the dynamo up to its polarity and proper voltage. This method has the disadvantages,
of the uncertainty as to the machine building up, and that a temporary wire must
probably be run from the switchboard to one terminal of the field circuit, which is usually
connected to a terminal back of the dynamo frame, so that the flow of current through
the field coils may be reversed. With dynamos having laminated field magnet cores of
comparatively low residual magnetism, this method may suffice, but in the case of solid
field magnetic cores it is not practical. A better method is to disconnect the shunt
field leads and temporarily extend them to some other source of direct current. If the
current be of higher voltage than the coils are designed for, as for instance 110 volt
dynamo and available current 500 volt, caution must be exercised and a suitable resistance
be provided to protect the coils. A 500 volt coil, however, may be supplied from
110 volt circuit, providing the field winding to be energized is equipped with a cut off
switch having a discharge resistance, so that it may be used to close and break the circuit
when the temporary leads have been connected. If the field windings be not so provided,
a bank of lamps or some other non-inductive resistance must be connected across the
leads between the field magnet coils and the point at which the circuit is to be opened
and closed. This is to provide a path for the discharge of the induced electromotive
force. The circuit should not remain closed more than a few seconds if the full voltage
can be applied. It is well, however, to leave the current on long enough to run the
machine up to about half speed and make sure, by means of a voltmeter, that the polarity
has been corrected. When this has been ascertained the dynamo should be stopped and
the field winding leads returned to their proper terminals. Then the voltage will be
brought up in the right direction, provided the work has been done correctly.
</p>
</div>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_587">[587]</a></span>
This can be tested by connecting a voltmeter across the terminals of
the armature, or by means of a magnetic needle placed at a short distance
from one of the pole pieces in such a position that it does not point
to the north pole. If the field coils be improperly connected, the current
due to the initial voltage will weaken the field magnetism and thus prevent
the machine building up, and when the field circuit is closed the
voltmeter reading will be reduced, or the magnetic needle will be less
strongly attracted.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Ques. What will be the result if the connections of
some of the field coils of a dynamo be reversed?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. If one-half the number of coils oppose the other half,
the field magnetism will be neutralized and the machine will not
build up at all; but if one of the coils be opposed to the others,
the machine might build up, but the generated voltage will be
low, and there will be considerable sparking at some of the
brushes.
</p>
<p><b>Ques. How may it be ascertained which coil is reversed?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. In all dynamos there should be an equal number of
positive and negative poles, and in almost all of them the poles
should be alternately positive and negative. Therefore, if a
pocket compass be brought near the pole pieces, and it show that
there are more poles of one kind than the other, the indication
is that one or more of the coils are reversed, and the improper
sequence of alternation will determine which one is wrongly
connected.
</p>
<p><b>Ques. When a dynamo loses its residual magnetism,
how can it be made to build up?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. By temporarily magnetizing the field. To do this a
current is passed through it from another dynamo, or from
the cells of a small primary battery. Usually, this will set up
sufficient initial magnetism to allow the machine to build up.
The battery circuit should be broken before the machine has
built up to full voltage.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_588">[588]</a></span>
<b>Ques. What should be done if a dynamo become
reversed by a reversal of its field magnetism due to lightning,
short circuit, or otherwise?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. The residual magnetism should be reversed by a current
from another dynamo, or from a battery; but if this be not
convenient, the connections between the machine and the line
should be crossed so that the original positive terminal of the
dynamo will be connected to the negative terminal of the line,
and vice versa.

compound dynamos, and essential connections. The current from any machine connected

method of reversing the polarity of No. 1 machine is as follows: No. 1 machine should
be at rest and then make sure that the circuit breaker and negative switch are open and
that any other special connections to other machine or station lighting circuits are open.
Then close the positive and equalizer switches, thus allowing a part of the current from
the other dynamo to pass through the equalizer connection and through the series field
winding of No. 1 machine in the usual direction, which will magnetize the magnetic core.
If No. 1 machine be a large unit and No. 2 a small unit, it will be necessary to cut out
the resistance of the shunt field circuits by means of the rheostat, if it be desired to
maintain its bus bar voltage at its normal point. This will rob the series winding of
any other machines which may be connected to the bus bars and will lower the voltage
slightly. No. 1 machine is then brought up to full speed when it will be found to have
recovered its correct polarity. The positive switch may be readily opened, watching the
bus bar voltage closely as it will rise when the current is restricted again to the series
field winding of the other machines. The dynamo will then be ready to cut in with the
other machines as soon as the voltage has been brought up to the proper point, or it may
be shut down until required.

<b>Ques. Can a dynamo be reversed by reversing the
connections between the field coils and the armature?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. No, for if these connections be reversed, the machine
will not build up.
</p>
<p><b>Ques. Will a dynamo build up if it become reversed?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. Yes.
</p>
<p><b>Ques. Then what is the objection to a reversed dynamo?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. Since the direction of current of a reversed dynamo is
also reversed, serious trouble may occur if it be attempted to
connect it in parallel, with other machines not reversed.
</p>
<p><b>Attention while Running.</b>--When a dynamo is started and
at work, it will need a certain amount of attention to keep it
running in a satisfactory and efficient manner. The first point
to be considered is the adjustment of the brushes. If this be
neglected, the machine will probably spark badly, and the
commutator and brushes will frequently require refitting to
secure good contact.
</p>
<p><b>Ques. What may be said with respect to the lead of
the brushes?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. The lead in all good dynamos is very small, and varies
with the load and class of machine. The best lead to give to the
brushes can in all cases be found by rotating the rocker and
brushes in either direction to the right or left of the neutral plane
until sparking commences, increasing with the movement.
The position midway between these two points is the correct
position for the brushes, for at this position the least sparking
occurs, and it is at this position that the brushes should be
fixed by clamping the rocker.

  />
<p class="caption"><a id="Fig_680"></a><span class="smcap">Fig</span>. 680.--Method of taking temperature. In taking the temperature of a hot part, it is convenient
to use a thermometer in which the scale of degrees has been etched on the stem.
Bind this to the heated part, having first taken the precaution to cover the bulb with
waste to prevent the radiation of heat and take the reading when the column of mercury
has ceased to rise. The question which most often presents itself to the attendant is how
hot can the various parts of a dynamo or motor become and yet be within the safe limit.
The degree of heat can be determined by applying the hand to the various parts. If the
heat be bearable it is entirely harmless, but if the heat become unbearable to the hand for
more than a few seconds, the safety limit has been reached and the machine should be
stopped and the fault located. Of course when the solder begins to melt at the commutator
connections and shellac begins to "fry out" of the armature and an odor of burnt cotton
begins to pervade the air, the safe limit has been far exceeded, and in most cases, as a
matter of fact serious damage is the result. To be more definite, <i>no part of the dynamo
or motor should be allowed to rise in temperature more than 80 degrees F. above the temperature
of the surrounding air</i>, excepting in the case of commutators where no solder has been
used to connect the leads. These can be allowed to rise to a still higher temperature.
</p>
</div>
<p><b>Ques. How does the lead vary in the different types of
dynamo?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. In series dynamos giving a constant current, the
brushes require practically no lead. In shunt and compound dynamos
the lead varies with the load, and therefore the brushes
must be rotated in the direction of rotation of the armature with
an increase of load, and in the opposite direction with a decrease
of load.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In cases where the dynamos are subjected to a rapidly varying or
fluctuating load, it is of course not possible to constantly shift the
brushes as the load varies, therefore the brushes should be fixed in the
positions where the least sparking occurs at the moment of adjustment.

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_591">[591]</a></span>
If at any time violent sparking occur, which cannot be reduced or
suppressed by varying the position of the brushes by rotating the
rocker, the machine should be shut down at once, otherwise the commutator
and brushes are liable to be destroyed, or the armature burnt
up. This especially refers to high tension machines.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Ques. What should be done if the brushes begin to
spark excessively?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. First, look at the ammeter to see if an excessive amount
of current is being delivered; second, see if the brushes make
good contact with the commutator, and if the latter have a bar
too high, or too low, and an open circuit.

space, a metal ring may be attached to the shaft as in <a href="#Fig_681">fig. 681</a>. With this arrangement
the high speed of the shaft will carry the oil outside of the ring and throw it off in the oil
reservoir. Another way is to insert a tin apron, as shown in <a href="#Fig_682">fig. 682</a> at T, which will serve
to drain the oil which may creep along the shaft, and also cut off the draft from the pulley
which may suck the oil out of the bearing. Sometimes a tin fan is attached to the pulley,
which tends to drive the oil back into the bearing, and which also assists in keeping the
box cool.
</p>
</div>
<p><b>Ques. What should be done if the current be excessive?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. If the current exceed the rated capacity by more than
50 per cent., and continue for more than a few minutes, the
main switch should be opened, otherwise the machine may be
seriously injured.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_592">[592]</a></span>
<b>Ques. How does an excessive current injure a dynamo?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. By causing it to overheat which destroys the insulation
of the armature, commutator, etc.
</p>
<p><b>Lubrication.</b>--The shaft bearings of dynamos may be
lubricated by sight feed oilers or oil rings. The latter method is
almost universally used. An oil well is provided in the hollow
casting of the pedestals as shown in <a href="#Fig_728">fig. 728</a>. Oil rings revolve
with the shaft and feed the latter with oil, which is continuously
brought up from the reservoir below. The dirt settles to
the bottom and the upper portion of the oil remains clear for a
long period, after which it is drawn off through the spigot and a
fresh supply poured in through openings provided in the top.
The latter are often located directly over the slots in which the
rings are placed, so that the bearings can be lubricated directly
by means of an oil cup, if the rings fail to act or the reservoir
become exhausted.

these minute irregularities interlock and act as a retarding force, or frictional resistance.
Hence, the necessity for lubrication--a lubricant presents a thin intervening film against
which the surfaces rub.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_593">[593]</a></span>
<b>Ques. What kind of oil can should be used in filling the
reservoir, or oil cups?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. One made of some non-magnetic material such as
copper, brass, or zinc.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If iron cans be used, they are liable to be attracted by the field magnets,
and thus possibly catch in the armature.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Ques. What is the indication of insufficient lubrication?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. The bearings become unduly heated.
</p>
<p><b>Ques. What precaution should be taken with new
dynamos?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. They are liable to heat abnormally and for the first
few days they should be carefully watched and liberally supplied
with oil.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After a dynamo has been running for a short time under full load, its
armature imparts a certain amount of heat to the bearings, a little more
also to the bearing on the commutator end of shaft; beyond this there
is no excuse for excessive heating. The latter may result from various
causes, some of which are given with their remedies, as follows:
</p>
<ol>
<li>A poor quality of oil, dirty or gritty matter in the oil;
</li>
<li>Journal boxes too tight;
</li>
<li>Rough journals, badly scraped boxes;
</li>
<li>Belt too tight;
</li>
<li>Bearings out of line;
</li>
<li>Overloaded dynamo;
</li>
<li>Bent armature shaft.
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Ques. What is the allowable degree of heating?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. It may be taken as a safe rule that no part of a working
dynamo should have a temperature of more than 80° Fahr. above
that of the surrounding air.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Accordingly, if the temperature of the engine room be noted before
applying the thermometer to the machine, it can at once be seen if the
latter be working at a safe temperature. In taking the temperature,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_594">[594]</a></span>
the bulb of the thermometer should be wrapped in a woolen rag. The
screws and nuts securing the different connections and cables should be
examined occasionally, as they frequently work loose through vibration.

<p class="caption"><a id="Fig_684"></a><span class="smcap">Fig</span>. 684.--Diagram illustrating forces acting on a dynamo armature. In the figure the normal
field magneto-motive force is in the direction of the line 1, 2, produced by the field circuit
G, if there were no current in the armature. But as soon as the armature current flows,
it produces the opposing force 3, 4, which must be combined with 1, 2 to give the
resulting force to produce magnetism and hence voltage. The resultant 1, 5, if 3, 4 be
large enough, does not differ much from the original force 1, 2. Or, expressed in a more
physical way, the brushes E, F, rest on the commutator and all the turns embraced by twice
the angle 6, 3, F, oppose the flow of flux through the armature core as well as all the turns
embraced by twice the angle, 7, 3, E. The remaining turns distort the flux, making the
pole corners at A and B denser, and at C and D rarer. So that all the effect is to kill an
increase of flux, or voltage. This cross magnetism tends also to decrease the flow of
flux, for the extra ampere turns required to force the flux through the dense pole tips are
greater than the decreased ampere turns relieved by the reduction of flux at the other pole
tips; this follows, since iron as it increases in magnetic density requires ampere turns greater
in proportion than the increase of flux.

</div>
<p><b>Instructions for Stopping Dynamos.</b>--When shutting
down a machine, the load should first be gradually reduced, if
possible, by easing down the engine; then when the machine is
supplying little or no current, the main switch should be opened.
This reduces the sparking at the switch contacts, and prevents
the engine racing.
</p>
<p>When the voltmeter almost indicates zero, the brushes should
be raised from contact with the commutator. This prevents the
brushes being damaged in the event of the engine making a
backward motion, which it often does, particularly in the case of

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_595">[595]</a></span>
a gas engine. On no account, however, should the brushes be
raised from the commutator while the machine is generating any
considerable voltage; for not only is the insulation of the machine
liable to be damaged, but in the case of large shunt
dynamos, the person lifting the brushes is liable to receive a
violent shock.
</p>
<p><b>Ques. What attention should the machine receive after
it has been shut down?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. It should be thoroughly cleaned. Any adhering copper
dust, dirt, etc., should be removed from the armature by dusting
with a stiff brush, and the other portions of the machine should
be thoroughly cleaned with linen rags. Waste should not be
used, as it is liable to leave threads or fluff on the projecting
parts of the machine, and on the windings of the armature,
which is difficult to remove.
</p>
<p><b>Ques. What attention should be given to the brushes
and brush gear?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. They should be examined and thoroughly cleaned. If
necessary the brushes should be refitted and readjusted. All
terminals, screws, bolts, etc., should be carefully cleaned and
screwed up ready for the next run. The brush holders should
receive special attention, as when dirty, they are liable to stick
and cause sparking. All dirt and oil should be removed from the
springs, contacts, pivots, and other working parts.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is advisable at stated intervals to entirely remove the brush holders
from the rocker arms, and give them a thorough cleaning by taking
them to pieces, and cleaning each part separately with emery cloth and
benzoline or soda solution.
</p>
<p>Another point to which particular attention should be given is the
cleaning of the brush rocker. This being composed wholly of metal,
and the two sets of positive and negative brushes being only separated
from it by a few thin insulating washers, it follows that if any copper
dust given off by the brushes be deposited in the neighborhood of these
washers, there is considerable liability for a short circuit of the machine
to occur by the dust bridging across the insulation.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_596">[596]</a></span>
<b>Ques. What further attention should be given?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. It is a good plan, when the machine has been thoroughly
cleaned and all connections made secure, to occasionally
test the insulation of the different parts. If a record be kept of
these tests, any deterioration of the insulation can at once be
detected, localized and remedied before it has become sufficiently
bad to cause a breakdown.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a means of protecting the machine from any moisture, dirt, etc.,
while standing idle, it is advisable to cover it with a suitable waterproof
cover.

COUPLING OF DYNAMOS
</h2>
<p><b>Series and Parallel Connections.</b>--When it is necessary
to generate a large and variable amount of electrical energy, as
must be done in central generating stations, apart from the
question of liability to breakdown, it is neither economical nor
desirable that the whole of the energy should be furnished from
a single dynamo. Since the efficiency of a dynamo is dependent
upon its output at any moment, or the load at which it is worked
(the efficiency varying from about 95 per cent. at full load to
80 per cent. at half load), it is advisable in order to secure the
greatest economy in working, to operate any dynamo as near
full load as possible.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Under the above circumstances, when the whole of the output is
generated by a single dynamo this can evidently not be effected, for the
load will naturally fluctuate up and down during the working hours, as
the lamps, motors, etc., are switched into and out of circuit; hence,
although the dynamo may be working at full load during a certain
portion of the day, at other times it may probably be working below
half load, and therefore the efficiency and economy in working in such
an arrangement is very low.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Ques. How is maximum efficiency secured with variable
load?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. It is usual to divide up the generating plant into a
number of units, varying in size, so that as the load increases,
it can either be shifted to machines of larger size, or when it
exceeds the capacity of the largest dynamo, the output of one

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_598">[598]</a></span>
can be added to that of another, and thus the dynamos actually
at work at any moment can be operated as nearly as possible at
full load.
</p>
<p><b>Ques. What should be noted with respect to connecting
one dynamo to another?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. It is necessary to take certain precautions (as later
explained) in order that the other dynamos may not be affected
by the change, and that they may work satisfactorily together.
</p>
<p><b>Ques. What are the two methods of coupling
dynamos?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. They are connected in series, or in parallel.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In coupling dynamos in series, the current capacity of the plant is
kept at a constant value, while the output is increased in proportion to
the pressures of the machines in circuit.
</p>
<p>When connected in parallel, the pressures of all the machines are kept
at a constant value, while the output of the plant is increased in proportion
to the current capacities of the machines in circuit.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Coupling Series Dynamos in Series.</b>--Series wound dynamos
will run satisfactorily together without special precautions
when coupled in series, if the connections be arranged as in <a href="#Fig_685">fig. 685</a>.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The positive terminal of one dynamo is connected to the negative
terminal of the other, and the two outer terminals are connected directly
to the two main conductors or bus bars through the ammeter A, fuse F,
and switch S. If it be desired to regulate the pressure and output of the
machines, variable resistances, or hand regulators R, R<sup>1</sup>, may be arranged
as shunts to the series coils as shown, so as to divert a portion
or the whole of the current therefrom.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Series Dynamos in Parallel.</b>--Simple series wound dynamos
not being well adapted for the purpose of maintaining a constant
pressure, are in practice seldom coupled in parallel; the conditions
or working, however, derive importance from the fact that

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_599">[599]</a></span>
compound dynamos, being provided with series coils, are subject
to similar conditions when working in parallel, which is frequently
the case.
</p>
<p><b>Ques. What may be said with respect to coupling two
or more plain series dynamos in parallel?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. The same procedure cannot be followed as in the case
of plain shunt dynamos, for the reason that if the voltage of the
dynamo to be coupled be exactly equal to that of the bus bars
when connected in parallel, the combination will be unstable.
</p>
<div class="image">
  <img src="images/f685.png"

<p class="caption"><a id="Fig_685"></a><span class="smcap">Fig</span>. 685.--Diagram showing method of coupling series dynamos in series. R and R' are two
hand regulators which are placed in shunt across the coil terminals to regulate the pressure
and output of the machine.
</p>
</div>
<p><b>Ques. Why is this?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. If, from any cause, the pressure at the terminals of one
of the dynamos fall below that of the others, it immediately
takes a smaller proportion of the load; as a consequence, the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_600">[600]</a></span>
current in its field coils is reduced, and a further fall of pressure
immediately takes place. This again causes the dynamo to relinquish
a portion of its load, and again occurs a further fall of
pressure. Thus the process goes on, until finally the dynamo
ceases to supply current, and the current from the other dynamos
flowing in its field coils in the reverse direction reverses its
magnetism, and causes it to run as a motor against the driving
power in the opposite direction to that in which it previously
ran as a dynamo.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Under such circumstances the armature is liable to be destroyed if
the fuse be not immediately blown, and in any case it is subjected to
a very detrimental shock. This tendency to reverse in series dynamos
can be effectually prevented by connecting the field coils of all the
dynamos in parallel.

A, A', are ammeters; F, F', fuses; S, S', switches.
</p>
</div>
<p><b>Ques. How are the field coils of all the dynamos connected
in parallel?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. This is effected in practice by connecting the ends of all
the series coils where they join on to the armature circuit by a

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_601">[601]</a></span>
third connection, called the "equalizing connection," or "equalizer,"
as shown in <a href="#Fig_686">fig. 686</a>.
</p>
<p><b>Ques. What is the effect of the equalizer?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. The immediate effect is to cause the whole of the current
generated by the plant to be divided among the series coils of the
several dynamos in the inverse ratio of their resistance, without
any regard as to whether this current comes from one armature,
or is divided among the whole. The fields of the several dynamos
being thus maintained constant, or at any rate being caused
to vary equally, the tendency for the pressure of one dynamo
to fall below that of the others is diminished.
</p>
<p><b>Shunt Dynamos in Series.</b>--The simplest operation in
connection with the coupling of dynamos, and the one used probably
more frequently in practice than any other, is the coupling
of two or more shunt dynamos to run either in series or in parallel.
When connected in series, the positive terminal of one machine
is joined to the negative of the other, and the two outer terminals
are connected through the ammeter A, fuses F, F', and switch
S, to the two main conductors or omnibus bars as represented in
<a href="#Fig_687">fig. 687</a>. The machine will operate when the connections are
arranged in this manner, if the ends of the shunt coils be connected
to the terminals of their respective machines.
</p>
<p><b>Shunt Dynamos in Parallel.</b>--The coupling of two or more
shunt dynamos to run in parallel is effected without any difficulty.
This method of coupling dynamos is one that is very frequently
used. <a href="#Fig_688">Fig. 688</a> illustrates diagrammatically the method of
arranging the connections. The positive and negative terminals
of each machine are connected respectively to two massive
insulated copper bars, shown at the top of the diagram, called
<i>omnibus bars</i>, through the double pole switches, S, S', and

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_602">[602]</a></span>
the double pole fuses F, F'. Ammeters, A, A' are inserted
in the main circuit of each machine, and serve to indicate the
amount of current generated by each. An automatic switch or
cutout, Ac, Ac', is also shown as being included in the main
circuit of each of the machines, although this appliance is sometimes
dispensed with. The pressure of each of the machines is
regulated independently by means of the hand regulators R, R',
inserted in series with the shunt circuit.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The shunt circuits are represented as being connected to the positive
and negative terminals of the respective machines, but in many cases
where the load is subjected to sudden variations, and when a large
number of machines is connected to the bus bars, the shunt coils are
frequently connected direct to these. In such circumstances this
method is preferable, as by means of it the fields of the idle dynamos
can be excited almost at once direct from the bus bars by the current
from the working dynamos; hence, if a heavy load come on suddenly,
no time need be lost in building up a new machine previous to switching
it into parallel. The pressure of the lamp circuit is given by a voltmeter

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_603">[603]</a></span>
whose terminals are placed across the bus bars; and the pressure at the
terminals of each of the machines is indicated by separate voltmeters
or pilot lamps, the terminals of which are connected to those of the
respective machines.

</p>
</div>
<p><b>Ques. Describe a better method of parallel connection.</b>

<p>Ans. Better results are obtained by connecting both the
shunt coils in series with one another, so that they form one long
shunt between the two main conductors, the same as in <a href="#Fig_687">fig. 687</a>.
</p>
<blockquote>

<p><b>Switching Dynamo Into and Out of Parallel.</b>--In order
to put an additional dynamo in parallel with those already working,
it is necessary to run the new dynamo up to full speed, and,
when it excites, regulate the pressure by means of a hand regulator
until the voltmeter connected to the terminals of the
machines registers one or two volts more than the voltmeter

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_604">[604]</a></span>
connected to the lamp circuit, and then close the switch. The
load upon the machine can then be adjusted to correspond with
that upon the other machines by means of the hand regulator.
</p>
<p><b>Ques. In connecting a shunt dynamo to the bus bars,
must the voltage be carefully adjusted?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. There is little danger in overloading the armature in
making the connection hence the pressure need not be accurately
adjusted.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is, in fact, common practice in central stations to judge the voltage
of the new dynamo merely by the appearance of its pilot lamp.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Ques. How is a machine cut out of the circuit?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. When shutting down a machine, the load or current
must first be reduced, by gradually closing the stop valve of the
engine, or inserting resistance into the shunt circuit by means of
the hand regulator; then when the ammeter indicates nine or
ten amperes, the main switch is opened, and the engine stopped.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By following this plan, the heavy sparking at the switch contacts is
avoided, and the tendency for the engine to race, reduced.

<p><b>Ques. What precaution must be taken in reducing the
current?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. Care must be taken not to reduce the current too
much.
</p>
<p><b>Ques. Why is this necessary?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. There is danger that the machine may receive a reverse
current from the other dynamos, resulting in heavy sparking at
the commutator, and in the machine being driven as a motor.
</p>
<p><b>Ques. What provision is made to obviate this danger?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. Dynamos that are to be run in parallel are frequently
provided with automatic cutouts, set so as to automatically

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_605">[605]</a></span>
switch out the machine when the current falls below a certain
minimum value.
</p>
<p><b>Dividing the Load.</b>--If a plant, composed of shunt dynamos
running in parallel, be subjected to variations of load, gradual
or instantaneous, the dynamos will, if they all have similar
characteristics, each take up an equal share of the load. If,
however, as is sometimes the case, the characteristics of the
dynamos be dissimilar, the load will not be shared equally, the
dynamos with the most drooping characteristics taking less than
their share with an increase of load, and more than their share
with a decrease of load. If the difference be slight, it may be
readily compensated by means of the hand regulator increasing
or decreasing the pressures of the machines, as the load varies.
If, however, the difference be considerable, and the fluctuations
of load rapid, it becomes practically impossible to evenly divide
the load by this means.
</p>
<p>Under such circumstances, the pressure at the bus bars is
liable to great variations, and there is also liability of blowing the
fuses of the overloaded dynamos, thus precipitating a general
breakdown. To cause an equal division of the load among all the
dynamos, under such circumstances, it is needful to insert a small
resistance in the armature circuits of such dynamos as possess
the straightest characteristics, or of such dynamos as take more
than their share of an increase of load. By suitably adjusting
or proportioning the resistances, the pressures at the terminals
of all the machines may be made to vary equally under all variations
of load, and each of the machines will then take up its
proper share of the load.
</p>
<p><b>Coupling Compound Dynamos in Series.</b>--Since compound
dynamos may be regarded as a combination of the shunt
and series wound machines, and as no special difficulties are

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_606">[606]</a></span>
encountered in running these latter in series, analogy at once
leads to the conclusion that compound dynamos under similar
circumstances may be coupled together with equal facility.
</p>
<p><b>Ques. How are compound dynamos connected to
operate in series?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. The series coils of each are connected as in <a href="#Fig_685">fig. 685</a>, and
the shunt coils are connected as a single shunt as in <a href="#Fig_687">fig. 687</a>, which
may either extend simply across the outer brushes of the machines,
so as to form a double short shunt, or may be a shunt to the bus
bars of external circuit, so as to form a double long shunt.

<p><b>Compound Dynamos in Parallel.</b>--Machines of this type
will not run satisfactorily together in parallel unless all the
series coils are connected together by an equalizing connection,
as in series dynamos. The method of arranging the connections

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_607">[607]</a></span>

of it idle machines are completely disconnected from those at
work.
</p>
<p><b>Ques. How is the equalizer connected?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. The equalizer is connected direct to the positive brushes
of all the dynamos, a three pole switch being fitted for disconnecting
it from the circuit when the machine to which it is connected
is not working. The two contacts of the switch are respectively
connected to the positive and negative conductors,
while the central contact is connected to the equalizer.

<p><b>Switching a Compound Dynamo Into and Out of Parallel.</b>--If
the characteristics of all the dynamos be similar, and the
connections arranged as in figs. 690, or 691, the only precaution

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_608">[608]</a></span>
to be observed in switching a new machine into parallel is to
have its voltage equal, or nearly equal to that of the bus bars
previous to closing the switch. If this be the case, the new
machine will take up its due share of the load without any shock.
</p>

F, F' fuses; A, A' ammeters, which indicate the total amount of current generated by each
of the machines; AC, AC', automatic switches, arranged for automatically switching out
a machine in the event of the pressure at its terminals being reduced through any cause;
R, R,' are hand regulators, inserted in the shunt circuits of each of the machines, by means
of which the pressures of the individual machines may be varied and the load upon each
adjusted. The pressure at the bus bars is given by the voltmeter V, one terminal of which
is connected to each of the bars; a second voltmeter may be used, to give the pressure of
any individual machine, by connecting "voltmeter keys" to the terminals of each of the
machines, or a separate voltmeter may be used for each individual machine. The only
essential difference between figs. 690 and 691 is, that in <a href="#Fig_690">fig. 690</a> the equalizer is connected
direct to the positive brushes of all the dynamos, while in <a href="#Fig_691">fig. 691</a> the equalizer is brought
up to the switchboard and arranged between the two bus bars, a switch being fitted for
disconnecting it from the circuit when the machine to which it is connected is not working.
</p>
</div>
<p><b>Ques. How is a compound dynamo, running in parallel,
cut out of circuit?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. The load is first reduced to a few amperes, as in the case
of shunt dynamos, either by easing down the engine, or by

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_609">[609]</a></span>
cutting resistance into the shunt circuit by means of the hand
regulator, and then opening the switch. Previous to this,
however, it is advisable to increase the voltage at the bus bars to
a slight extent, as while slowing down the engine the load upon
the outgoing dynamo is transferred to the other dynamo armatures,
and the current in their series coils not being increased in
proportion, the voltage at the bus bars is consequently reduced
somewhat.
</p>
<p><b>Equalizing the Load.</b>--When a number of compound dynamos
of various output, size, or make, are running together in
parallel, it frequently happens that all their characteristics are
not exactly similar, and therefore the load is unequally distributed,
some being overloaded, while others do not take up
their proper share of the work.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>NOTE</b>.--The action of an equalizing bar in equalizing the load on compound dynamos run
in parallel may be explained as follows: The compound winding of a dynamo raises the pressure
in proportion to the current flowing through it, and if, in a system of parallel operated compound
dynamos without the equalizing connection, the current given by one machine were slightly
greater than the currents from the others, the pressure of that machine would increase. With
this increase in pressure above the other machines, a still greater current would flow, and so
raise the pressure further. The effect is therefore cumulative, and in time the one dynamo
would be carrying too great a proportion of the whole current of the system. With the equalizing
connection, whatever the current flowing from each machine, the currents in the various
compound windings are all equal, and so the added pressure due to the compound winding is
practically the same in each machine. Any inequality in output from the machines is readily
eliminated by adjusting the shunt currents by means of the shunt rheostats. When compound
wound dynamos are operated in parallel, the equalizer bar insures uniform distribution among
the series coils of the machines.
</p>
<p><b>NOTE</b>.--To secure the best results in parallel operation, dynamos should be of the same
design and construction and should possess as nearly as possible the same characteristics; that is,
each should respond with the same readiness, and to the same extent, to any change in its field
excitation. Any number of such machines may be operated in parallel. The usual practice is
to connect the equalizer and the series field to the positive terminal, though if desired, they
may be connected to the negative terminal; both however, must be connected to the same
terminal. The resistance of the equalizer should be as low as possible, and it must never be
greater than the resistance of any of the leads from the dynamos to the bus bar. Sometimes a
third wire is run to the switchboard from each dynamo and there connected to an equalizer bar,
but the usual practice is to run the equalizer directly between the dynamos and to place the
equalizer switches on pedestals near the machines. This shortens the connections and leads to
better regulation. The positive and equalizer switches of each machine differ in pressure only
by the slight drop in the series coil, and in some large stations these two switches are placed
side by side on a pedestal near the machine. In such cases, the equalizer and positive bus bars
are often placed under the floor near the machines, so that all leads may be as short as possible.
If all the dynamos be of equal capacity, all the leads to bus bars should be of the same length,
and it is sometimes necessary to loop some of them.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_610">[610]</a></span>
If the difference be small, it may be compensated by means
of the hand regulator; if large, however, other means must be
taken to cause the machines to take up their due proportion of
the load.
</p>
<p>If the series coils of the several dynamos be provided with
small adjustable resistances, in the form of German silver or
copper ribbon inserted in series with the coils, the distribution
of the current in the latter may be altered by varying the
resistance attached to the individual coils. The effect of the
series coils upon the individual armatures in raising the pressure
may be adjusted, and the load thus evenly divided among the
machines.
</p>
<p><b>Shunt and Compound Dynamos in Parallel.</b>--It is
not practicable to run a compound dynamo and a shunt
dynamo in parallel, for, unless the field rheostat of the shunt
machine be adjusted continually, the compound dynamo will
take more than its share of the load.

DYNAMO FAILS TO EXCITE
</h2>
<p>This trouble is of frequent occurrence in both old and new
machines. If a dynamo fail to excite, the operator should first
see that the brushes are in the proper position and making good
contact, and that the external circuit is open if the machine be
shunt wound, and closed if series wound.
</p>
<p>In starting a dynamo it should be remembered that shunt and
compound machines require an appreciable time to build up,
hence, it is best not to be too hasty in hunting for faults.
</p>
<p>The principal causes which prevent a dynamo building up are:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Brushes not properly adjusted;
</li>
<li>Defective contacts;
</li>
<li>Incorrect adjustment of regulators;
</li>
<li>Speed too low;
</li>
<li>Insufficient residual magnetism;
</li>
<li>Open circuits;
</li>
<li>Short circuits;
<ul>
<li><i>a.</i> In external circuits;
</li>
<li><i>b.</i> In dynamo.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Wrong connections;
</li>
<li>Reversed field magnetism.
</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Brushes not Properly Adjusted.</b>--If the brushes be not in
or near their correct positions, the whole of the voltage of the
armature will not be utilized, and will probably be insufficient to

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_612">[612]</a></span>
excite the machine. If in doubt as to the correct positions, the
brushes should be rotated by means of the rocker into various
points on the commutator, sufficient time being given the machine
to excite before moving them into a new position.
</p>
<p><b>Defective Contacts.</b>--If the different points of contact of
the connections of the machine be not kept thoroughly clean and
free from oil, etc., it is probable that enough resistance will be
interposed in the path of the exciting current to prevent the
machine building or exciting. Each of the contacts should
therefore be examined, cleaned, and screwed up tight.
</p>
<p><b>Ques. Which of the contacts should receive special
attention?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. The contact faces of the brushes and surface of the
commutator. These are very frequently covered with a slimy
coating of oil and dirt, which is quite sufficient to prevent the
machine exciting.
</p>
<p><b>Incorrect Adjustment of Regulators.</b>--When shunt and
compound machines are provided with field regulators, it is
possible that the resistance in circuit may be too great to permit
the necessary strength of exciting current passing through the
field windings. Accordingly, the fault is corrected by cutting
out more or less of the resistance. The field coils of series machines
are sometimes provided with short circuiting switches or
resistances arranged to shunt the current across the field coils.
If too much of the current be shunted across, the switch should
be opened, or if there be a regulator, it should be so adjusted
that it will pass enough current through the field windings to
excite the machine.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_613">[613]</a></span>
<b>Speed too Low.</b>--In shunt and compound dynamos there is
a certain critical speed below which they will not excite. If the
normal speed of the machine be known, it can be seen whether
the failure to excite arises from this cause, by measuring the
speed of the armature with a speed indicator. In all cases it is
advisable, if the machine do not excite in the course of a few
minutes, to slightly increase the speed. As soon as the voltage
rises, the speed may be reduced to its regular rate.

  />
<p class="caption"><a id="Fig_692"></a><span class="smcap">Fig</span>. 692.--Method of testing for break by short circuiting the terminals of the machine. If
the external circuit test out apparently all right, and there be no defective contacts in
any part of the machine, and all short circuiting switches, etc., be cut out of circuit, the
machine still refusing to excite, short circuiting the terminals of the machine should be tried.
This should be done very cautiously, especially in case of a high tension machine. It is
advisable to have, if possible, only a portion of the load in circuit, and the short circuit
should be effected as shown in the figure. The short circuit may be made by momentarily
bridging across the two terminals of the machine with a single piece of wire. As this, however,
is liable to burn the terminals, a better plan is to fix a short piece of scrap wire in one
terminal, and then with another piece of insulated wire make momentary contacts with the
other terminal and the short piece of wire. If the machine excite, it will be at once evident
by the arc which occurs between the two pieces of wire. As the voltage of a series machine
when induced to build in this manner generally rises very rapidly, great care should be
taken that the contact is at first only momentary, merely a rubbing or scraping touch
of the wires. The contact may be prolonged if the machine do not excite at the first
contact. Compound wound machines can often be made to excite quickly by short circuiting
their terminals in this manner.
</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_614">[614]</a></span>
<b>Insufficient Residual Magnetism.</b>--This fault is not of
frequent occurrence; it takes place chiefly when the dynamo is
new, and may be remedied by passing the current from a few
storage cells, or from another dynamo, for some time in the
proper direction through the field coils. If a heavy current, such
as is obtainable from a storage battery, be not available, and the
machine be shunt or compound wound, a few primary cells
arranged as in <a href="#Fig_693">fig. 693</a> will generally suffice.
</p>
<div class="image">
  <img src="images/f693.png"

  />
<p class="caption"><a id="Fig_693"></a><span class="smcap">Fig</span>. 693.--Method of overcoming insufficient residual magnetism. The flexible "lead" L of
the dynamo D is disconnected from the positive terminal of the machine, and is connected
to the negative or zinc pole of the battery B, the other or positive carbon pole being connected
to the terminal, from which the lead was removed, and shunt circuit S. As thus
arranged, it will be seen that the battery B is in series with the armature and shunt circuit,
and therefore its voltage will be added to any small voltage generated in the armature.
When the machine is started, the combined voltages will probably be able to send sufficient
current through the shunt to excite the machine. As the voltage rises and the strength
of the current in the shunt windings increases, the flexible lead may be again inserted into
the terminal from which it was removed. The battery will thus be short circuited, and
may be cut out of circuit without any danger of breaking the shunt circuit, and thus causing
the machine to demagnetize.
</p>
</div>
<p><b>Open Circuits.</b>--Dynamos are affected by open circuits in
different ways, depending upon the type. Series machines require
closed circuit to build up, while an open circuit is necessary

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_615">[615]</a></span>
with the shunt machine. An open circuit may be due to: 1,
broken wire or faulty connection in the machine; 2, brushes
not in contact with commutator; 3, safety fuse blown or removed;
4, circuit breaker open; 5, switch open; 6, external
circuit open. If the trouble be due merely to the switch or
external circuit being open, the magnetism of a shunt machine
may be at full strength, and the machine itself may be working
perfectly, but if the trouble be in the machine, the field magnetism
will probably be very weak. Open circuits are most
likely to occur in:
</p>
<ol>
<li>The armature circuit;
</li>
<li>The field circuit;
</li>
<li>The external circuit.
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>When the open circuit is due to the brushes not making good contact,
simple examination generally reveals the fact.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Ques. What causes breaks in the field circuit?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. Bad contacts at the terminals, broken connections, or
fracture of the coil windings.
</p>
<p><b>Ques. How is the field circuit tested for breaks?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. The flexible leads attached to the brushes are removed
from their connections with the field circuit, and the latter is
then tested for conductivity with a galvanometer.
</p>
<p><b>Ques. Where is a break likely to occur in a shunt
machine?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. In the hand regulator through a broken resistance coil
or bad contact.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Very frequently the fault occurs in the connecting wires leading from
the machine to the hand regulator fixed upon the switchboard, or in
the short wires connecting the field coils to the terminals or brushes.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_616">[616]</a></span>
The insulation of a broken wire will sometimes hold the two ends
together so as to defy any but the most careful inspection or examination;
therefore, in order to avoid loss of time, it is advisable to disconnect
the wires if possible, and test each separately for conductivity
with a battery and galvanometer connected, as in <a href="#Fig_694">fig. 694</a>. If the fault
be not located in the various connections, the magnet coils should be
tested with the battery and galvanometer coupled up as in <a href="#Fig_706">fig. 706</a>, care
being first taken to disconnect the ends of each of the coils. A faulty
coil will not show any deflection of the galvanometer.

terminals T&nbsp;T under test in turn. If a deflection of the needle be produced when the galvanometer
terminal is in contact with either, the terminals are in contact with the frame,
and they should then be removed, and the fault repaired by additional insulation or by
reinsulating.
</p>
</div>
<p><b>Ques. At what point of a shunt coil does a break usually
occur?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. At the point where the wire passes through the flanges
of the spool or bobbin.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_617">[617]</a></span>
<b>Ques. How should the coil be repaired?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. In most cases a little of the wood or metal of which the
flange is made can be gouged or chipped out, and a new connecting
wire soldered on to the broken end of the coil without much
difficulty.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If it be necessary to take the magnets apart at any time, care should
be taken in putting them together again to wipe all faces perfectly clean,
and screw up firmly into contact, and to see that the connections of the
coils are made as they were before being taken apart.
</p>
<p>If the faulty coil cannot be repaired quickly, and the machine is
urgently required, the coil may be cut out of circuit entirely, or short
circuited, and the remaining coils coupled up so as to produce the
correct polarity in the pole pieces.

the temperature may exceed a safe limit. If this occur, a resistance
may be put in circuit with the field coils, or the speed of
the dynamo reduced.

<b>Ques. What kind of dynamo is affected by breaks in
the external circuit?</b>

<p>Ans. A series dynamo.
</p>
<p><b>Ques. Name the kind of break that is difficult to locate.</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. A partial break.
</p>
<p><b>Short Circuits.</b>--In a series or compound dynamo a short
circuit or heavy load will overload the machine and cause the
fuses to blow. A shunt machine will not excite under these
circumstances, for the reason that practically the whole of the
current generated in the armature passes direct to the external
circuit, and the difference of potential between the shunt terminals
is practically nil.
</p>
<p><b>Ques. What should be done if it be suspected that the
failure to excite arises from this cause?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. The main leads should be taken out of the dynamo
terminals, then, if due to this cause, the machine will excite.
</p>
<p><b>Ques. What parts of a dynamo are specially liable to
be short circuited?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. The terminals, brush holders, commutator, armature

</p>
<p>Ans. The terminals of the various circuits of the machine
are liable to be short circuited, either through metallic dust
bridging across the insulation, or through the terminals making
direct contact with the frame of the machine.
</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Ans. By measuring the resistance of each coil with an ohmmeter
or Wheatstone bridge. The faulty coils will show a much less

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_621">[621]</a></span>
resistance than the perfect coils. The fault may also be discovered
and located by passing a strong current from a battery or
another dynamo through each of the coils in turn, and observing
the relative magnetic effects produced by each upon a bar of iron
held in their vicinity.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The short circuit may be in the terminals or connections, and these
should first be examined and tested.
</p>
<p>Some series dynamos are provided with a resistance, arranged in
parallel or shunt with the field coils, to divert a portion of the current
therefrom, and thus regulate the output.
</p>
<p>When making a series dynamo excite, all resistances and controlling
devices should be temporarily cut out of circuit by opening the shunt
circuit. Series machines have frequently a switch which short circuits
the field coils. Care should be taken that this is open, or otherwise the
machine will not excite.

and so mounted on the core as to insure rapid dissipation of heat by ventilation. Each

<p><b>Wrong Connections.</b>--When a machine is first erected, the
failure to build up may be due to incorrect connections.
The whole of these latter should therefore be traced or followed

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_622">[622]</a></span>
out, and compared with the diagrams of dynamo connections
given in figs. 190 to 198.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes errors are made in connecting the field coils, causing them
to act in opposition. This may occur when the dynamo is a new one or
the coils have been removed for repairs. It may be caused either through
the coils having been put on the field cores the wrong way, or through
incorrect coupling up. Under these circumstances, the dynamo, if bipolar,
will fail to excite; and if multipolar, poles will be produced in the
yokes, etc. It may be remedied by removing one of the coils from the
core and putting it on the reverse way, or by reversing its connections.
The correctness of connections of all the coils should be verified.
</p>
<p>In compound dynamos it sometimes happens that the machine will
excite properly, but that the series coils tend to reverse the polarity of
the dynamo, thus reducing the voltage as the load upon the machine
increases. This may be detected when the machine is loaded by short
circuiting the <i>series coils</i>, not the <i>terminals</i>. If the voltage rise in doing
this, the series coils are acting in opposition to the shunt coils, and the
connections of the <i>series coils</i> must be reversed.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Reversed Field Magnetism.</b>--This is sometimes caused
by the nearness of other dynamos, but is generally due to reversed
connections of the field coils. Under such conditions the
field coils tend to produce a polarity opposed to the magnetization
to which they owe their current, and therefore the
machine will refuse to excite until the field connections are
reversed, or a current is sent from another dynamo or a battery
through the field coils in a direction to produce the correct
polarity in the pole pieces.

ARMATURE TROUBLES
</h2>
<p>A large proportion of the mishaps and breakdowns which
occur with dynamos and motors arise from causes more strictly
within the province of the man in charge than in that of the
designer. The armature, being a complex and delicately built
structure, is subject in operation to various detrimental influences
giving rise to faults.
</p>
<p>Many of the faults which occur are avoided by operators
better informed as to the electric and magnetic conditions which
obtain in the running of the machine, especially the mechanical
stresses on the copper inductors due to the magnetic field and
the necessity of preserving proper insulation.
</p>
<p>The chief mishaps to which armatures are subject are as
follows:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Short circuits;
<ul style='list-style-type:lower-alpha;'>
<li>In individual coils;
</li>
<li>Between adjacent coils;
</li>
<li>Through frame or core;
</li>
<li>Between sections of armature;
</li>
<li>Partial short circuits.

</ul>
</li>
<li>Grounds;
</li>
<li>Breaks in armature circuit.

</ol>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_624">[624]</a></span>
<b>Short Circuit in Individual Coils.</b>--This is a common
fault, which makes its presence known by a violent heating of
the armature, flashing at the commutator, flickering of the light
on lighting circuits, and by a smell of burning varnish or overheated
insulation. When these indications are present, the
machine should be stopped at once, otherwise the armature is
liable to be burnt out. The fault is due either to metallic dust
lodging in the insulation between adjacent bars of the commutator,
or to one or more convolutions of the coils coming into
contact with each other, either through a metallic filing becoming
embedded in the insulation or damage to the insulation.

  />
<p class="caption"><a id="Fig_700"></a><span class="smcap">Fig</span>. 700.--Method of locating short circuited armature coil. Disconnect the external and field
circuits from the armature, and pass a large current--say from 20 to 100 amperes--from a
battery (B) or another dynamo through the whole armature by means of the brushes.
Then, having previously well cleaned the commutator, measure the difference of potential
between adjacent segments all round the commutator (C), by means of a voltmeter or
galvanometer (G), the terminals of which are connected to adjacent segments, as shown.
The short circuited coil or coils will be located by the difference of potential between the
corresponding segments being little or nothing. It may be remarked, however, that this
is not always a decisive test. In some cases the short circuit may be intermittent, or may
disappear as soon as the armature ceases to rotate. In such cases, the short circuit is caused
by the wire coming into contact through the action of the centrifugal forces developed by
the rotation of the armature.
</p>
</div>
<p><b>Ques. How is the faulty coil located?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. When the machine is stopped, the faulty coil, if not
burnt out, can generally be located by the baked appearance of
the varnish or insulation, and by its excessive temperature over

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_625">[625]</a></span>
the rest of the coils, being detected also by the baked appearance
of the varnish or insulation.
</p>
<p><b>Ques. What should be done if the machine do not
build, and it be suspected that the fault is due to short
circuited armature coils?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. The field magnets should be excited by the current
from a storage battery or another dynamo, and, having raised the
brushes from contact with the commutator, the armature should
be run for a short time. In stopping, the faulty coil or coils may
be located by the heat generated by the short circuit.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the dynamo is started for the purpose of localizing a short
circuit, precautions should be taken, and the machine only run for a few
minutes at a time until the faulty coil is detected.
</p>
<p>When the faulty coil has been located, the insulation between the
segments of the commutator to which its ends are connected should be
carefully examined for anything that may bridge across from segment
to segment, and scraped clean. If the commutator be apparently all

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_626">[626]</a></span>
right, the fault probably lies in the winding. The insulation of the
winding should be carefully examined, and any metallic filings or other
particles discovered therein carefully removed, and a little shellac varnish
applied to the faulty part.

be a distinct click in the receiver as each segment passes under the brushes until one brush
bears on the segment at fault, when the clicking will cease. In making this test, the
brushes must not cover more than a single segment.
</p>
</div>
<p><b>Ques. If the insulation on adjacent conductors has
been abraded, how should it be repaired?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. A small boxwood or other hardwood wedge, coated with
shellac varnish should be driven in tightly between the wire;
this will generally be sufficient.

<p class="caption"><a id="Fig_702"></a><span class="smcap">Fig</span>. 702.--Bar to bar test for open circuit in coil or short circuit in one coil or between segments.
If, in testing as in <a href="#Fig_701">fig. 701</a>, on rotating the armature completely around, the receiver indicate
no break in the leads, connect the battery leads directly to the brushes, as shown in the
above figure, and touch the connections from the receiver to two adjacent bars, working
from bar to bar. The clicking should be substantially the same between any two commutator
bars; if the clicking suddenly rise in tone between two bars, it indicates a high
resistance in the coil or a break (open circuit).
</p>
</div>
<p><b>Ques. If a faulty coil cannot be quickly repaired and
the dynamo be needed, what should be done?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. The coil may be cut out of circuit, and the corresponding
commutator segments connected together with a piece of
wire (of a size proportionate to the amount of current to be
carried), soldered to each. It will not be necessary to cut out
and remove the entire coil.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_627">[627]</a></span>
If the active portions only be separated so that they do not form a
closed circuit, it will answer the purpose. If the wires be cut with a chisel
at the point where they pass over the ends of the core, and the ends
separated, it will be quite as effective as removing the entire coil. It is
wise, of course, to rewind the coil at the first opportunity.

bars are in contact, or a coil between two segments becomes short circuited, the
bar to bar test described in <a href="#Fig_702">fig. 702</a> will detect the fault by the telephone receiver remaining
silent. If a short circuit be found, the leads from the receiver should then include or
straddle three commutator bars, as here shown. The normal click will then be twice that
between two segments until the faulty coils are reached, when the clicking will be less.
When this happens, test each coil for trouble and, if individually they be all right, the trouble
is between the two. To test for a ground place one terminal of the receiver on the shaft
or frame of the machine, and the other on the commutator. If there be a click it indicates
a ground. Move the terminal about the commutator until the least clicking is heard and
at or near that point will be found the contact. Grounds in field coils can be located in
the same manner.
</p>
</div>
<p><b>Short Circuits between Adjacent Coils.</b>--In ring armatures
the presence of this fault does not necessarily imply that
the machine will not build; in drum armatures, wound into a
single layer of conductors, it entirely prevents this occurring.
</p>
<p>Reference to a winding diagram will show that adjacent coils
are during a certain period of the revolution at the full difference
of pressure generated by the machine. Hence, if any two adjacent
coils be connected together or short circuited, the whole of the
armature will be practically closed on itself, any current generated
flowing within the armature only.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_628">[628]</a></span>
Large drum armatures wound with compressed and stranded
bars and connectors are particularly susceptible to this fault, a
slight blow generally forcing one or more of the strands into
contact with the adjacent bars, thus short circuiting the armature,
and rendering it practically useless so far as the generation
of current is concerned. In this class of short circuit in drum
armatures, the method of locating the faulty coils by exciting
the field, and running the armatures on open circuit, does
not apply, for the reason that the whole armature will be heated
equally.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A method of locating such fault is illustrated in <a href="#Fig_704">fig. 704</a>. This applies
to drum wound armatures. Faults of this description can frequently
be discovered by a careful inspection of the windings of the armature
without recourse to testing. When located, the fault can usually be repaired
with a hardwood wedge, as explained above, or a piece of mica or
vulcanized fibre cemented in place with shellac varnish.
</p>

<p class="caption"><a id="Fig_704"></a><span class="smcap">Fig</span>. 704.--Method of locating short circuits between adjacent armature coils. Fasten a monkey
wrench to the rim of the pulley, or a crank to the shaft. Now, excite the fields, and,
to make the effects more marked, connect the coils in parallel. When this has been done
it will require considerable force to rotate the armature, and then it will move quite
slowly, except at one position. When this position has been found, mark the armature
at points in the center of the pole pieces at points A and B and at both ends of the armature.
The explanation is that both halves of the armature oppose one another at this position;
but when not at these points a continuous circuit is formed, and the resultant magnetic
effect is considerable. The "cross" or "short" circuit is nearly always found on the commutator
end in the last half of the winding, where the wires pass down through the first
half terminals. This applies to an unequal winding. In armatures where the windings are
equal, it is as liable to occur at one point as at another. With this method a defect can be
found and remedied in a few moments, for it has always been a simple matter to repair it
when discovered. These results can be observed in a perfect armature by connecting the
opposite sections of the commutator.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_629">[629]</a></span>
<b>Short Circuits between Sections through Frame or Core
of Armature.</b>--Detection of this fault can be effected by the
methods described above, and by disconnecting the whole of
the armature coils from the commutator and from each other,
and testing each separately with a battery and galvanometer
coupled up as in <a href="#Fig_705">fig. 705</a>, one wire being connected to the shaft
and the other to the end of the coil under test. As a rule, there
is no way of remedying this fault other than unwinding the
defective coils, reinsulating the core, and rewinding new coils.

<p class="caption"><a id="Fig_705"></a><span class="smcap">Fig</span>. 705.--Method of locating short circuits between coils through armature core. The
galvanometer, battery and coil to be tested are connected in series as shown, and then the
unconnected terminal of the galvanometer is brought into contact with the shaft. If then
some portion of the insulation of the wire has been abraded or destroyed, thus bringing
the bare wire into contact with the metal core, as at A in the figure, the needle of the galvanometer
will be deflected since a closed circuit is formed through the core and wire. If
the insulation be perfect, the needle will not be deflected. It will thus be seen that in the
conductivity test (<a href="#Fig_700">fig. 700</a>) it is necessary that the needle should be deflected, or turned,
to prove that all is right, while in the insulation test the converse holds good; if the needle
be deflected, it proves that the insulation is broken down.
</p>
</div>
<p><b>Short Circuits between Sections through Binding Wires.</b>--This
fault is the result of a loose winding, and is caused by the
insulation upon which the binding wires are wound giving way,
thus bringing coils at different pressures together. As a consequence
of the heavy current which flows, the binding wires are
as a rule unsoldered or burned. The location of the fault can

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_630">[630]</a></span>
therefore be effected by simple inspection. To remedy, it will be
necessary to unwind and rewind on new binding wires, on bands
of mica or vulcanized fibre, soldering at intervals to obviate
flying asunder.
</p>
<p><b>Partial Short Circuits in Armatures.</b>--This is usually due
to the presence of moisture in the windings. To remedy the
fault, the armature should be taken out and exposed to a
moderate heat, or subjected to a current equal to that ordinarily
given by the dynamo. Under the action of heat or of
this current the moisture will be gradually dispersed. When
thoroughly dry, and while still warm, a coat of shellac should
be applied to the whole of the windings.

the coil under test. The other terminal of the galvanometer is connected to the other end
of the coil. If the connecting wires be making good electrical contact with the respective
terminals, and the wire of coil being tested be unbroken, the needle of the galvanometer
will be deflected as soon as a closed circuit is made by the end of the coil coming into contact
with the galvanometer terminal. If the wire of the coil be broken in some part or the
ends of the connecting wires do not make good electrical contact with the terminals, the
needle will not be deflected. In order to prevent mistakes, it is advisable to test the battery
and galvanometer connections and contacts by short circuiting or bringing the ends of the
wire connecting the terminal of the galvanometer and negative pole or the battery together
before starting to test the circuit or coil. If the needle be deflected, the connections are
all right; if not deflected, there is a bad contact somewhere, which must be made good
before the test can proceed.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_631">[631]</a></span>
<b>Burning of Armature Coils.</b>--The reason for the burning
of an armature coil may be explained as follows: The coil,
segments, and the short circuit between the segments form a
closed circuit of low resistance so that it is only necessary to have
a low pressure set up in the active portion of the coil to force a
very large current through the coil and the short circuited commutator
bars. The heating effect of this current is sufficient to
burn out the coil.

saturated with an insulating compound and again baked for twelve hours to make them
practically oil and water proof. Heavy flexible leads are brought out to avoid danger of
breaking or other damage.
</p>
</div>
<p><b>Cutting Out Damaged Armature Coils.</b>--To cut out a
damaged coil from an armature, first, disconnect the coil from
the commutator, and after cutting off the leads, insulate the
exposed parts with tape. Then connect the commutator bars
(which were connected with the leads) with a wire of the same size
as the wire winding.
</p>
<p>To remove the coil entirely, cut the band wire or remove the
wedges, and lift up a sufficient number of leads and coils to
permit of the removal of the damaged coil.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_632">[632]</a></span>
<b>Grounds in Armatures.</b>--These faults occur when the
armature coils become connected to the frame or core of the
armature. When this grounding is confined to a single coil, it
is not in itself liable to do damage. A simple method of locating
a grounded coil is illustrated in <a href="#Fig_708">fig. 708</a>.
</p>
<div class="image">

<p class="caption"><a id="Fig_708"></a><span class="smcap">Fig</span>. 708.--Method of locating grounded armature coil. B is a battery or dynamo circuit
giving a current of a few amperes through the armature by its own brushes (1 and 2). At
G is placed a roughly made galvanometer, to carry some 25 amperes or so, one terminal
being in connection with the shaft of the armature, and the other attached to a movable
brush 3. Since the function of the particular galvanometer is simply to show a deflection
when a current is passing, and to mark zero when there is none, a coil of thick wire with a
pocket compass in the center will do all that is required, but care must be taken to remove
it sufficiently far away from the disturbing effects of the armature magnetism. The manner
of testing is as follows: Assume a steady current to be flowing from battery B through the
armature; touch the commutator with brush 3, and a current will flow through G.
Slowly rotate the armature or the brush 3 until the galvanometer G shows no deflection.
The coil in contact with 3 will be found to be <i>grounded</i>. A hand regulator or rheostat R
may be inserted in series with the battery or dynamo circuit to regulate the strength of the
current passing.
</p>
</div>
<p><b>Ques. What is the advantage of this test?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. The damaged coil can be located without unsoldering
the coils from the commutator, which is sometimes a difficult
operation without proper tools; further, the fault can frequently
be repaired without disconnecting any of the wires if its exact
position be determined.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_633">[633]</a></span>
<b>Magneto Test for Grounded Armatures.</b>--A magneto test
for grounded armatures is not to be recommended, as armatures
often possess sufficient static capacity to cause a magneto to
ring even though there be no leak. This is due to the alternating
current given by the magneto for when the circuit has capacity
it acts as a condenser and at each revolution of the armature of
the magneto a rush of current goes out and returns, charging the
surfaces of the conductor alternately in opposite directions, and
ringing the bell during the process.

<p class="caption"><a id="Fig_709"></a><span class="smcap">Fig</span>. 709.--Method of binding armature winding. Complete appliances for handling armatures
in making repairs are usually not available with most street railway companies, since they are
so seldom required. When needed, therefore, some temporary contrivance must be resorted
to for help in the dilemma. Should an armature burn out, some local concern that makes
coils and rewinds armatures may be available to do the work; again, it will be necessary
to send to the manufacturers for a man, as soon as coils can be made ready for the work.
In no case should any but an experienced man be given charge of this work. But if there be
any doubt as to whether the armature is really burnt out, let a competent man be the
judge. When a large armature needs repairing, a pair of chain tongs can be used on
some part of the shaft when putting in the coils, and a block and tackle, as shown, can be
used, when putting on the band wires. Do not finish one band and then cut off the wire,
but run it over for the next, etc. Then solder and trim off the wires.
</p>
</div>
<p><b>Breaks in Armature Circuit.</b>--A partial or complete break
in the armature circuit is always accompanied by heavy sparking
at the commutator, but not, as a rule, by an excessive heating
of the armature or slipping of the belt, and this enables the
fault to be distinguished from a short circuit. The faulty part
can always be readily located by the "flat" which it produces

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_634">[634]</a></span>
upon the surface of the commutator. The armature circuit
being open at the faulty part, heavy sparking results at every
half revolution as the brushes pass over it, and as a consequence
the corresponding segments become "pitted" or "flattened"
with respect to the others; they may easily be discovered on
examination.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Breaks in the armature circuit may occur in either the commutator
or in the coils of the armature. To ascertain whether it be in the latter,
carefully examine the winding of the faulty coil.
</p>
<p>The defect may be sought for <b>more</b> particularly at the commutator
end of the armature, as breaks in the wire are most frequent where the
connections are made with the commutator segments. If no break can
be discovered, try passing a heavy current through the faulty coil by
means of the brushes.
</p>
<p>If a partial break exist with sufficient contact to pass a current, the
coil will be heated at that point and may be discovered by running the
fingers over the coil.
</p>
<p>When located, the fault may be repaired by rewinding the coil, or
carefully cleaning the broken ends and jointing.
</p>
<p>The fault may also be temporarily repaired by soldering the adjacent
commutator segments together without disconnecting the coil.

CARE OF THE COMMUTATOR AND BRUSHES
</h2>
<p>For satisfactory operation, the brushes and commutator must
be kept in good condition. To this end the main thing to be
guarded against is the production of sparks at the brushes. If
care be taken in the first instance to adjust the brushes to their
setting marks, and to regulate their pressure upon the commutator,
and afterwards to attend to the lead as the load varies, so
that little or no sparking occurs, and also to keep the brushes
and commutator free from dirt, grit, excessive oil, etc., the surface
of the commutator will assume a dark burnished appearance
and wear will practically cease. Under these circumstances the
commutator will run cool, and will give very little trouble.
</p>
<p>In order to maintain these conditions it will only be necessary
to see that the brushes are kept in proper condition and
fed forward to their setting marks, as they wear away, and
that the commutator is occasionally polished.
</p>
<p>If the pressure of the brushes upon the commutator be too
great, or their adjustment faulty, or the commutator be allowed
to get into a dirty condition, sparking will result, and, if not at
once attended to and remedied, the brushes will quickly wear
away, and the surface of the commutator will be destroyed. As
this action takes place, in the earlier stages, the surface of the
commutator will become roughened or scored, resulting in

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_636">[636]</a></span>
jumping of the brushes, and increased sparking; in the later
stages, the commutator will become untrue and worn into ruts,
moreover, owing to the violent sparking which takes place
through this circumstance, the machine will quickly be rendered

NOTE.--In operating dynamos having metal brushes, it is of importance to keep the
commutator smooth and glossy. To accomplish this, it is necessary to keep the commutator
and brushes clean and free from grit, and to occasionally lubricate the commutator with some
light oil, such as ordinary machine oil. This should be done daily if the machine be in constant
use. Keep the brushes resting upon the commutator with just enough pressure to insure a
good firm contact. This will be found to be much less than the springs are capable of exerting.
A good method to follow in cleaning the machine is as follows: Loosen the brush holder thumb
screws and tilt the brushes off the commutator (or, if box brush holders be used, take them
out of their holders). Then run the machine and hold a clean cloth against the commutator.
After the commutator is clean, hold against it a cloth or piece of waste moistened with machine
oil and reset the brushes. If for any reason the brushes begin to cut or score the commutator,
it may be readily detected by holding the finger against the commutator; the ridge may be
easily felt by the finger. This should be attended to at once in the following manner: Tilt back
the brushes (or if box brushes are used take them out of their holders), and hold lightly against
the commutator a piece of No. 00 sandpaper well moistened with oil, passing it back and forth
until the surface is perfectly smooth. Then wipe off the commutator with a clean piece of
cloth or waste and lubricate with another clean piece moistened with oil and reset the brushes.

</p>
</div>
<p><b>Ques. How is the commutator easily tested as to the
condition of its surface?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. It is readily tested by resting the back of the finger
nail upon it while in motion; the nail being very sensitive to any
irregularities, indicates at once any defect.
</p>
<p><b>Ques. What causes grooves or ridges to be cut in the
commutator?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. They result from using brushes with hard burnt ends
which are not pliable; also by too great a pressure of the brush
upon the commutator surface.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sparking at the brushes is expensive and detrimental, chiefly because
it results in burning the brushes and also the commutator, necessitating
their frequent renewal. Every spark consumes a particle of copper,
torn from the commutator or brush. The longer the sparking continues,
the greater the evil becomes, and the remedy must be applied without
delay.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Ques. What kind of oil should be used on the commutator?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. Mineral oil.
</p>
<p><b>Ques. What attention should be given to the brushes?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. At certain intervals, according to the care taken to
reduce sparking and the length of time the machine runs, the
brushes will fray out or wear unevenly, and will therefore need
trimming. They should then be removed from the brush holders
and their contact ends or faces examined. If not truly square,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_637">[637]</a></span>
they should be filed or clipped with a pair of shears, the course
of treatment differing with the type of brush.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the machine be fitted with metal strip brushes, frayed ends should be
clipped square with a pair of shears, the ends thoroughly cleaned from
any dirt or carbonized oil, and replaced in their holders. Gauze and wire
brushes require a little more attention. When their position on the
commutator has been well adjusted and looked after, so that little or no
sparking has taken place, it is generally only necessary to wipe them, clean
the brushes and clip off the fringed edges and corners with the shears,
or a pair of strong scissors. If, however, the machine has been sparking,
the faces will be worn or burnt away, and probably fused. If such be
the case, they will need to be put in the filing clamp, and filed true.
</p>
<p>A convenient method of trimming carbon brushes, or of bedding a
complete new set of metal brushes, is to bind a piece of sandpaper, face
outwards, around the commutator after the current has been shut off, and
then mount the carbon or metal brushes in the holders, adjusting the
tension of the springs so that the brushes bear with a moderately strong
pressure upon the sandpaper. Then let the machine run slowly until the
ends of the brushes are ground to the proper form. Care should be taken,
however, that the metal dust given off does not get into the commutator
connections or armature windings, or short circuiting will result.
</p>
<p>If the contact faces of the brushes are very dirty and covered with a
coating of carbonized oil, etc., it will be necessary to clean them with
benzoline or soda solution before replacing.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_638">[638]</a></span>
<b>Ques. Describe a filing clamp.</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. As usually constructed, it consists of two pieces of
metal, both shaped at one end to the correct angle, to which the
brushes must be filed. One of the pieces of metal (the back part)
has a groove sufficiently large to accommodate the brush, which
is clamped in position by the other piece of metal and a pinching
screw.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the clamp be not supplied with the machine a convenient substitute
can be made out of two pieces of wood about the same width as the
brush. One end of each piece is sawn to the correct angle, and the brush
placed between the two.
</p>
<p>In filing, the brush is fixed in the clamp, with the toe or tip projecting
slightly over the edge of the clamp, and the latter being fixed in a vise,
the brush is filed by single strokes of a smooth file made outwards, the
file being raised from contact with the brush when making the back
stroke.

<p><b>Sparking.</b>--In all well designed machines there are certain
positions upon the commutator for the brushes at which there will
be no sparking so long as the commutator is kept clean and in
good condition. In other dynamos, badly designed or constructed,
sparking occurs at all positions, no matter where the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_639">[639]</a></span>
brushes are placed, and in such dynamos it is therefore impossible
to prevent this no matter how well they are adjusted.

fastening. The notches fit around rivets on one side of each fastening, which can be moved
by removing the two cotters. The clamp is made loose or taut by screwing the bolt in the
nut.
</p>
</div>
<p><b>Ques. What two kinds of sparking may be generally
distinguished?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. One kind of sparking is that due to bad adjustment of
the brushes, and a second kind, that due to bad condition of the
commutator.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sparks due to bad adjustment of the brushes are generally of a bluish
color, small when near the neutral plane, and increasing in violence and
brilliancy as the brushes recede from the correct positions upon the
commutator.
</p>
<p>When sparks are produced by dirty or neglected state of the commutator,
they are distinguished by a reddish color and a spluttering or
hissing. When due to this last mentioned cause, it is impossible to suppress
the sparking until the commutator and brushes have been cleaned.
In the former case, the sparks will disappear as soon as the brushes have
been rotated into the neutral points.
</p>
<p>Another class of sparks appear when there is some more or less developed
fault, such as a short circuit, or break in the armature or commutator.

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_640">[640]</a></span>
These are similar in character to those produced by bad adjustment of the
brushes, but are distinguished from the latter by their not decreasing
in violence when the brushes are rotated towards the neutral plane.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having distinguished the classes of sparks which appear at the
commutator of a dynamo, it remains to enumerate the causes
which produce them. These are:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Bad adjustment of brushes;
</li>
<li>Bad condition of brushes;
</li>
<li>Bad condition of commutator;
</li>
<li>Overload of dynamo;
</li>
<li>Loose connections, terminals, etc.;
</li>
<li>Breaks in armature circuit;
</li>
<li>Short circuits in armature circuit;
</li>
<li>Short circuits or breaks in field magnet circuit.
</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Bad Adjustment of Brushes.</b>--When sparking is produced
by bad adjustment of the brushes, it may be detected by rotating
or shifting the rocker, by the indication that the sparking will
vary with each movement.
</p>
<p>To obtain good adjustment of the brushes, it will be necessary
to rock them gently backwards and forwards, until a position is
found in which the sparking disappears.
</p>
<p><b>Ques. If, in rocking the brushes, a position cannot be
found at which the sparking disappears, what is the probable
cause of the trouble?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. The brushes may not be set with the proper pitch, that
is they may not be separated a correct distance, or the neutral
plane may not be situated in the true theoretical position upon
the commutator through some defect in the winding, etc.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this last named case, the brushes may be strictly adjusted to their
theoretically correct positions before starting the machine; then, when

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_641">[641]</a></span>
the machine is started and the load put on, violent sparking occurs, which
cannot be suppressed by shifting the rocker. If, however, one set of
brushes only be observed, it will generally be found that, at a certain
position, the sparking at the set of brushes under observation ceases or
is greatly reduced, while sparking still occurs at the other set. When
this position is found, the rocker should be fixed by the clamping screw,
and the brushes of the other set at which sparking is still occurring
adjusted by drawing them back or pushing them forward in their holders
until a position is found at which the sparking ceases. Correct position
of the brushes and the suppression of sparking is a matter of importance,
and any time spent in carefully adjusting the brushes will be amply
repaid by the decreased attention and wear of the brushes and commutator.

the shaded portion of figs. 713 and 714, will not allow the short circuited coil enough time
to reverse, causing sparking and heating. The latter will also result from bad contact on
account of the surface being too small for the current to be carried off. This form of bad
contact is worse than that shown in <a href="#Fig_715">fig. 715</a>, where the area of contact surface only is
lessened. If the brushes do not make good contact, they should be ground down.
</p>
</div>
<p><b>Bad Condition of Brushes.</b>--If the contact faces of the
brushes be fused or covered with carbonized oil, dirt, etc., there
will be bad contact which is accompanied by heating and sparking.
Simple examination will generally reveal whether this be
the case. The remedy is to remove the brushes, one at a time
if the machine be running, clean, file if necessary, trim, and
readjust.
</p>
<p>If the brushes be exceedingly dirty, or saturated with oil, it
will be necessary to clean them with turpentine, benzoline, or
soda solution, before replacing.
</p>
<p><b>Bad Condition of Commutator.</b>--If the surface of the
commutator be rough, worn into grooves, or eccentric, or if
there be one or more segments loose or set irregularly, the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_642">[642]</a></span>
brushes will be thrown into vibration, and sparking will result.
A simple examination of the commutator will readily detect
these defects. A rough and uneven commutator is due to bad
adjustment of brushes, bad construction of commutator, and to
neglect generally. If allowed to continue, it results in heavy
sparking at the brushes, and the eventful destruction of the
commutator. The fault may be remedied by filing or re-turning
the commutator.

</p>
</div>
<p><b>Ques. How is an untrue commutator detected?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. If the commutator be untrue, the fact will be indicated
when the machine is slowed down by a visible eccentricity, or
by holding the hand, or a stick in the case of a high tension
machine, against the surface while revolving, when any irregularity
or eccentricity will be apparent by the vibration or
movement of the stick. The only remedy for an untrue commutator
is to re-turn it in the lathe.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_643">[643]</a></span>
<b>Ques. What should be done in case of high segments?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. They should be gently tapped down with a mallet, and
if possible the clamping cones at the commutator end should
be tightened.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If it be impossible to hammer the segments down, they should be filed
down to the same diameter as the rest of the commutator, or the commutator
re-turned. For low segments, the only remedy is to pull
out the segments, or turn commutator down to their level.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Ques. Explain the term "flats on the commutator."</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. This is the name given to a peculiar fault which develops
on one or more segments of the commutator. It is not confined
to dynamos of bad design or construction, but frequently appears
on those of the highest class, and may be recognized as a "pitting"
or "flattening" of one or more segments.
</p>
<p><b>Ques. What is the effect of flats on the commutator?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. Sparking at the brushes.
</p>
<p><b>Ques. What are the causes which produce flats?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. Periodical jumping of the brushes due to a bad state
of the commutator, bad joint in the driving belt, a flaw, or a
difference in the composition of the metal of the particular bar
upon which it appears. But more frequently flats may be
traced to a more or less developed fault, such as a break, either
partial or complete, in the armature coil.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The break may occur either in the coil itself, or at the point where its
ends make connection with the lug of the commutator, or at the point
where the lug is soldered to the segment.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Ques. What should be done in case of flats?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. The brushes should be examined to see if any periodical
vibration take place. If such be the case, the cause should be
removed, the flat carefully filed or turned out, and the brushes
readjusted.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_644">[644]</a></span>
If it be due to a difference in the composition of the metal of which
the segment is made, the flat will exist as long as the particular segment
is in use, and will need periodic attention.
</p>
<p>With hard drawn copper or phosphor bronze segments, this fault is
rarely due to this last mentioned cause. It is more frequently due to
bad soldering, of the conductors to the lugs, or of the lugs to the segments.
In all cases of flats, if the disconnection in the armature circuit be not
complete, and cannot be readily located, the effect of re-soldering or
sweating the ends of the coils into the lugs should be tried. Flats may
also frequently be cured by drilling and tapping a small hole in the
junction between the lug and the segment, and inserting a small screw,
or bit of screwed copper or brass wire, afterwards filing down level with the
surface of the commutator.

<p class="caption"><a id="Fig_717"></a><a id="Fig_718"></a><span class="smcap">Figs</span>. 717 and 718.--Method of repairing broken joint between commutator segment and lug.
To repair such a break push asbestos in between adjacent bars, so that heat from the torch
will not affect them. Asbestos should also be worked in at the back if possible, for the
purpose of keeping solder from places where it would cause trouble. Then unsolder the
armature leads from the lug and remove the latter. Next, with specially made cape chisels,
cut in a slot in the commutator bar for a new lug. Care and skill are required not to destroy
the mica insulation between the segments. The slot should be cut one-quarter to
three-eighths inch deep. The connector is then soldered in place. With care a satisfactory
connection can be made in this way, which will last well. If it do not last, the trouble
in almost every case is due to poor soldering. Short circuits sometimes occur after this
operation, because of solder falling in at the back and lodging on lower connections. In
large machines, the excessive current flowing is quite likely to melt this solder, and the
machine may buck, throwing out the melted solder, after which it may be all right again.
While the bar connector is out, however, asbestos should be packed in back of it to prevent
this occurrence, which may be a serious affair. All surplus solder and the asbestos
packing should be removed after the connection is finished, and the connections cleaned
with compressed air. The armature should be turned over slowly, air being applied all
the while.
</p>
</div>
<p><b>Segments Loose or Knocked In.</b>--When the segments are
loose, it is an indication that the clamping ring or cone has worked
loose. This should therefore be tightened up, and the commutator
re-turned if necessary.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_645">[645]</a></span>
<b>Ques. How should low commutator segments be
treated?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. The commutator surface may be turned down to the
level of the low segment, or the latter may be pulled out again
to its former level, this latter being the preferable method, if it
can possibly be effected.
</p>
<p><b>Ques. How is a commutator segment pulled out to its
correct position?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. A hand vise is firmly clamped to the lug, or a loop of
copper wire is passed round the conductor where it joins the
commutator. A bar of iron, to act as a lever, is supported on a
fulcrum over the commutator, and one end of the bar is passed
through the loop or vise. Pressure is applied to the other end
which will generally bury the segment up to its proper position.
</p>
<p><b>How to Re-turn a Commutator.</b>--In re-turning the commutator,
the armature should first be carefully taken out of the
armature chamber, avoiding knocks or blows of any kind. The
whole of the winding should then be wrapped in calico or
canvas before the armature is put into the lathe, to prevent
any particles of metal becoming attached to the surface of the
armature at the time the commutator is being turned. The
armature should on no account be rolled upon the floor, or
subjected to blows or knocks while being put into the lathe.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In re-turning the commutator, a sharp pointed tool should be used
with a very fine feed. A broad nosed tool ought not to be used, as it is
liable to burr over the segments. After turning, the commutator should
be lightly filed with a dead smooth file, and finally polished with coarse
and fine sandpaper. After the commutator has been turned and polished,
the insulation between the segments should be lightly scraped with the
tang of a small file to remove any particles of metal or burrs which might
short circuit the commutator.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_646">[646]</a></span>
The points where the armature wires are soldered to the lugs should
also be carefully cleaned with a brush, and should then receive a coat
or two of shellac varnish.
</p>
<p>While the commutator is being turned, care should be taken that the
setting marks for the adjustment of the brushes are not turned out if
these be present. The same care should be used in putting the armature
back into the armature chamber as was used in taking it out, otherwise
the insulation may be damaged.

</p>
</div>
<p><b>Ques. Should the commutator be run without any
lubricant?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. In most cases it will be found that a little lubricant
is needed in order to prevent cutting the brushes, cutting the
commutator; this is especially the case when hard strip brushes
are used. The quantity of oil applied should be very small; a
few drops smeared upon a piece of clean rag, and applied to the
commutator while running, being quite sufficient.
</p>
<p><b>Ques. What kind of oil should be used on the commutator?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. Mineral oil, such as vaseline, or any other hydrocarbon.
Animal or vegetable oils should be avoided, as they

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_647">[647]</a></span>
have a tendency to carbonize, and thus cause short circuiting
of the commutator, with attendant sparking.

<p><b>Overload of Dynamo.</b>--It may happen, through some cause
or other that a greater output is taken from the machine than
it can safely carry. When this is the case, the fact is indicated
by excessive sparking at the brushes, great heating of the armature
and other parts of the dynamo, and possibly by the slipping
of the belt (if it be a belt driven machine), resulting in a noise.
The causes most likely to produce overload are:
</p>

<ol>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_648">[648]</a></span>
Excessive voltage;
</li>
<li>Excessive current;
</li>
<li>Reversal of polarity of dynamo;

<li>Short circuits or grounds in dynamo, or external circuits.

being used, one knob is grasped in one hand and the other knob in the other hand, the stone
being moved back and forth along the length of the commutator. As the stone will
become coated with copper at first, it must be cleaned frequently by means of coarse
sandpaper. The fine dust from the stone will get under the brushes and wear them to a
very close fit. After using the stone, finish with fine sandpaper.
</p>
</div>
<p><b>Ques. What are the causes of excessive voltage?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. Over excitation of the field magnet or too high speed.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the former case, resistance should be introduced into the field circuit
to diminish the current flowing therein if a shunt machine; or if a
series machine, a portion of the current should be shunted across the
field coils by means of a resistance arranged in parallel with the series

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_649">[649]</a></span>
coils; or the same effect may be produced in both cases by reducing the
speed of the armature if this be possible.
</p>
<p>If due to excessive speed, which will be indicated by a speed indicator,
the natural remedy is to reduce the speed of the engine driving the
dynamo, or, if this be not easily done, insert resistance into the dynamo
circuit, as described above.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Ques. What are the causes of excessive current?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. If the dynamo be supplying arc lamps, the excessive
current may possibly be caused by the bad feeding of the lamps.
If this be the case, the fact will be indicated by the oscillations
of the ammeter needle, and the unsteadiness of the light.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If incandescent lamps be in the circuit, the fault may be caused by
there being more lamps in circuit than the dynamo is designed to carry.
Under such circumstances, another dynamo should be switched into
circuit in parallel, or, if this be not possible, lamps should be switched off
until the defect is remedied.
</p>
<p>When motors are in the circuit, sparking frequently results at the
dynamo commutator, owing to the fluctuating load. In such cases the
brushes should be adjusted to a position at which the least sparking
occurs with the average load.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Ques. What may be said with respect to reversal of
polarity of dynamos?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. When compound or series wound dynamos are running
in parallel, their polarity is occasionally reversed while stopping
by the current from the machines at work.
</p>
<p><b>Loose Connections, Terminals, etc.</b>--When any of the
connecting cables, terminal screws, etc., securing the different
circuits are loose, sparking at the brushes, as a rule, results, for
the reason that the vibration of the machine tends to continually
alter the resistance of the various circuits to which they are
connected.
</p>
<p>When the connections are excessively loose, sparking also
results at their points of contact, and by this indication the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_650">[650]</a></span>
faulty connections may be readily detected. When this sparking
at the contacts is absent, the whole of the connections should be
carefully examined and tested.
</p>
<p><b>Breaks in Armature Circuit.</b>--If there be a broken circuit
in the armature, as sometimes happens through a fracture of
the armature connections, etc., there will be serious flashing or
sparking at the brushes, which cannot be suppressed by adjusting
the rocker. As a rule it results in the production of "flats"
upon one or more bars of the commutator.

</div>
<p><b>Short Circuits or Breaks in Field Magnet Circuit.</b>--Either
of these faults is liable to give rise to sparking at the
commutator. If one of the coils be short circuited, the fact will
be indicated by the faulty coil remaining cool while the perfect
coil is overheated. The fault may arise through some of the
connections to the coils making contact with the frame of the
machine or with each other. To ascertain this, examine all the
connections, and test with a battery and galvanometer. A total
break in one or more of the field coils may readily be detected by
means of the battery and galvanometer.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A partial break is not, however, so readily discovered, for the reason
that the coil wires may be in sufficiently close contact to give a deflection
of the galvanometer needle. The only methods of detecting this fault
is by measuring the resistance of the coils with an ohmmeter or

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_652">[652]</a></span>
Wheatstone bridge, or by placing an ammeter in circuit with each coil
in turn, and comparing the amount of current flowing in each. If the
partial break be not accessible, the only way to remedy the fault is to
rewind the coil, and the same applies to a break in the interior of
the coil.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Short Circuits in Commutator.</b>--These are of frequent
occurrence, and result in heating the armature and sparking
at the brushes. They are caused either by metallic dust or
particles lodging in the insulation between the segments, or by
the deterioration of the commutator insulation.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To remedy, the insulation between the segments should be carefully
examined, and any metallic dust, filings, or burrs cleaned or scraped out.
When the commutator is insulated with asbestos or pasteboard (as is
oftentimes the case in dynamos of European make), short circuits very
frequently occur through the insulation absorbing moisture or oil, which
is subsequently carbonized by the sparking at the brushes. In faults of
this description the only remedy is to expel all moisture from the commutator
insulation by means of heat, and scrape out all metallic dust
which may be embedded in the surface of the insulation. If this do not
effect a cure, it will be necessary to dig out the insulation, as far as possible,
with a sharp tool, and drive in new insulation. Oil should not be
used on commutators insulated with these materials, but only asbestos
dust or French chalk.

HEATING
</h2>
<p>The excessive heating of the parts of dynamos and motors is
probably the most frequent and annoying fault which arises in
operation. When the machine heats, it is a common mistake to
suppose that any part found to be hot is the seat of the trouble.
Hot bearings may cause the armature or commutator to heat,
or vice versa.
</p>
<p>All parts of the machine should be tested to ascertain which
is the hottest, since heat generated in one part is rapidly diffused.
This is best done by starting with the machine cold; any serious
trouble from heating is usually perceptible after a run of a few
minutes at full speed with the field magnets excited.
</p>
<p>Heating may be due to various electrical or mechanical causes,
and it may occur in the different parts of the machine, as in:
</p>
<ol>
<li>The connections;
</li>
<li>The brushes and commutator;
</li>
<li>The armature;
</li>
<li>The field magnet;
</li>
<li>The bearing.
</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Ques. How is heating detected?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. By applying the hand to the different parts of the
machine if low tension, or a thermometer if high tension, and
also by a smell of overheated insulation, paint, or varnish.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_654">[654]</a></span>
<b>Ques. What should be done if the odor of overheated
insulation, paint or varnish be noticeable?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. It is advisable to stop the machine at once, otherwise
the insulation is liable to be destroyed.
</p>
<p><b>Ques. What is the allowable rise of temperature in a
well designed machine?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. It should not exceed 80° Fahr., above the surrounding
air, and in the case of the bearings, this temperature ought not
to be reached under normal conditions of working.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If this limit be exceeded after a run of six hours or less, it indicates a
machine either badly designed and probably with the material cut down
to the lowest possible limit with a view to cheapness, or some fault or
other which should be searched for and remedied as early as possible,
otherwise the machine will probably be destroyed.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Ques. How should the rise of temperature be measured?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. It is not sufficient to feel the machine with the hand,
but special thermometers must be placed on the armature winding,
immediately on stopping the machine, covering them with
cotton or wool to prevent cooling. Readings must be taken at
short intervals, and continued till no further rise of temperature
is indicated.
</p>
<p><b>Heating of Connections.</b>--A rise of temperature of the
connections may be due to either excessive current, or bad contacts,
or both. The terminals and connections will be excessively
heated if a larger current pass through them than they are designed
to carry. This nearly always proceeds from an overload
of the dynamo, and if this be rectified, the heating will disappear.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the contacts of the different connections of the dynamo be not kept
thoroughly clean and free from all grit, oil, etc., and the connections
themselves be not tightly screwed up, heating will result, and the connections
may even become unsoldered.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_655">[655]</a></span>
<b>Heating  of  Brushes, Commutator  and  Armature.</b>--When
heating occurs in these parts, it may be due to any of the
following causes: 1, excessive current; 2, hot bearings; 3, short
circuits in armature or commutator; 4, moisture in armature
coils; 5, breaks in armature coils; 6, eddy currents in armature
core or conductor.

suitable openings being provided for this purpose as shown.
</p>
</div>
<p><b>Ques. What may be said with respect to excessive
current?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. When a dynamo is overloaded, the temperature of the
armature will rise to a dangerous extent, depending upon the
degree to which the safe capacity of the machine is exceeded, and
heavy sparking of the brushes will also result. If the overload
be not removed, the insulation of the armature may be destroyed.
</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_656">[657]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Ques. State some causes of hot bearings.</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. Lack of oil; presence of grit or other foreign matter in
the bearings; belt too tight; armature not centred with respect
to pole pieces; bearings too tight; bearings not in line; shaft
rough or cut.

  />
<p class="caption"><a id="Fig_728"></a><span class="smcap">Fig</span>. 728.--Self-oiling and self-aligning
bearing. The self-oiling feature consists of rings which
revolve with the shaft, and feed the latter with oil continually, which they bring up from
the reservoir below. The dirt settles to the bottom, and the upper portion of the oil
remains sufficiently clean for a long time, after which it is drawn off, and a fresh supply
poured in through holes provided in the top. These latter are often located directly
over the slots in which the rings are placed, so that the bearings can be lubricated immediately
by means of an oil cup if the rings fail to act or the reservoir become exhausted.
The bearing is made self-aligning by providing the bearing proper with an enlarged central
portion of spherical shape, held in a spherical seat formed in the pedestal by turning,
milling, or by casting Babbitt or other fusible metal around it, thus allowing the bearing
to adjust itself to the exact direction of the shaft. The upper half of the box can be
taken off to facilitate renewal, etc., and to permit the armature to be removed.
</p>
</div>
<p><b>Ques. What is the effect of hot bearings?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. Besides giving trouble themselves, the heat may be
conducted along the armature shaft and core, thus giving rise
to excessive heating of the armature.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_657">[657]</a></span>
POINTS RELATING TO HOT BEARINGS
</p>
<ol>
<li>Use good oil;
</li>
<li>See that oil cups or reservoirs are full and all oil passages clear;
</li>
<li>In self-oiling and splash systems where the oil is used over again, it
should be kept in clean condition by frequent straining;
</li>
<li>Keep bearings clean and properly adjusted;
</li>
<li>Maintain bearings in good alignment;
</li>
<li>Avoid tight belts;
</li>
<li>Examine the air gap or clearance between armature and pole
faces and see that they are uniform.
</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Ques. What troubles are encountered with short
circuits in the armature or commutator?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. This results in sparking at the brushes, and in the
heating of one or more of the armature coils, and even in the
burning up of the latter if a bad case.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the armature is overheated, and the defect does not proceed
from an overload or the causes mentioned below, the dynamo should be
immediately stopped and tested for this fault.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Ques. What will happen with an overheated commutator?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. It will decompose carbon brushes and cover the commutator
with a black film, which offers resistance and increases
the heat.
</p>
<p><b>Ques. What should be done if carbon brushes become
hotter than the other parts?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. Use higher conductivity carbon. Reduce length of
brush by adjusting holder to grip brush nearer the commutator.
Reinforce brushes with copper gauze, sheet copper or wires, or
use some form of combined metal and carbon brush. Increase
size or number of brush if necessary, so the current does not
exceed 30 amperes per square inch of contact.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_658">[658]</a></span>
Brushes heat sometimes due to too much friction. They should not
press against the commutator more than is necessary for good contact.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Ques. Give some causes for heating of armature.</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. Eddy currents; moisture; short circuits; unequal
strength of magnetic poles; operation above rated voltage, and
below normal speed.
</p>
<p><b>Ques. What trouble is encountered with eddy currents?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. Considerable heating of the whole of the armature
results, which may even extend to the bearings.

 is one inch in diameter and takes a 1/4 inch round belt. Weight
of motor 5-1/2 pounds.
</p>
</div>
<p><b>Ques. How can this be overcome?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. There is no remedy for eddy currents other than the
purchase of a new armature, or reconstruction.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fault may be detected by exciting the field magnets and running
the machine on open circuit, with the brushes raised off the commutator
for some time, when the armature will be found to be excessively heated.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_659">[659]</a></span>
<b>Ques. How does moisture in the armature coils affect
the armature?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. The effect of this fault being to practically short circuit
the armature, a heating of the latter results. In bad cases, steam
or vapor is given off.
</p>
<p><b>Ques. What is the effect of short circuits in the armature?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. It produces overheating.
</p>
<p><b>Ques. What trouble is likely to occur when the armature
is not centered in the armature chamber?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. A heating of the bearings is liable to be occasioned
through the attractive forces developed by the center of the
armature core not being parallel with the centre of the armature
chamber or bore, or through the core being nearer one pole piece
than the other.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This may result from unequal wearing of the bearings, and therefore
the bearings should either be relined or the bolt holes of the bearings
readjusted, or the bearings packed up until the armature is correctly
centered.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Ques. What happens in case of breaks in the armature
coils?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. This fault results in local heating of the armature, for
the reason that resistance is interposed in the path of the current
at the fracture. It always results in sparking at the brushes,
and the heating being confined to the neighborhood of the break.
</p>
<p><b>Ques. What are the effects of operation above the rated
voltage and below normal speed?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. Voltage above normal is a possible cause of heating,
and operation below normal speed calls for an increase of field
strength and reduces the effective ventilation, thus tending to
cause heating.

<p class="caption"><a id="Fig_730"></a><span class="smcap">Fig</span>. 730.--Forced system of lubrication as applied to engine of the generating set shown in
fig. 443. In engines employing the forced system of lubrication the crank pit, which is
formed by the columns, is accessible through doors in the front and back of the engine.
The base of the engine forms an oil tank to which is attached a small plunger pump driven
by an eccentric on the shaft. The lubricant is carried under pressure to the various parts
of the engine by the mechanism shown in the accompanying diagram. The oil is forced
by a pump to a groove in the main bearing, and a drilled hole in the shaft connects this
groove with the crank pin. From the crank pin box the oil is further forced to the wrist
pin through the pipe running along the side of the connecting rod. The passage in the
crosshead allows the oil to be forced from the wrist pin to the guides. As the oil is forced
from one bearing to another, it is quite important that the bearing caps be set tight,
otherwise the oil will escape before reaching the last bearing. After passing through the
bearings, the oil is collected in the base, strained and used again. The oil should be free
from foreign substances, and to guard against the introduction of any foreign matter,
a strainer, which may be taken out for examination or cleaning, is attached to the suction
valve of the pump. An oil pressure of from 10 to 20 lbs. should be maintained, and may
be regulated by adjusting the set screw on the relief valve of the oiling system. The
pressure gauge need not remain in the circuit continuously. Only mineral oils should
be used for lubrication. A heavy oil gives better results and prevents knocking more
effectively than thin oil. An oil which has been found to give good results, consists of
two-thirds red engine oil and one-third heavy cylinder oil. As the oil passes through
the bearings repeatedly, it gradually loses its lubricating properties, becoming thick and
gritty, and should be occasionally run through a filter and mixed with new oil. The
frequency of this change depends on the oil, as well as the number of hours the engine is
in operation, and can easily be determined by observation. The oil in the reservoir
should stand about 2 inches over the suction and discharge valves, and no water should
be allowed to mix with it. Should any water accumulate in the base, it should be drawn
off by the cock provided for the purpose before starting the engine.
</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_661">[661]</a></span>
<b>Ques. How may the field magnets become heated?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. By excessive field current; eddy current in pole pieces;
moisture; short circuits.
</p>
<p><b>Ques. What may be said with respect to excessive field
current?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. When heating results from this cause, all the exciting
coils will be heated equally. It may be due to excessive voltage,
in the case of shunt dynamos; or to an overload in the case of
compound and series dynamos. In either case it may be remedied
by reducing the voltage or overload. If due to the coils being
incorrectly coupled up, that is, coupled up in parallel instead of
in series, it will be necessary to rectify the connections or insert
a resistance in series.
</p>
<p><b>Ques. State the causes of eddy currents in the pole
pieces?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. This fault may be due to defective design or construction
of the armature. Slotted armatures are particularly
liable to cause this fault, if the teeth and air gap be not properly
proportioned. The defect may also be occasioned by variation
in the strength of the exciting current.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If due to this latter cause, it will be accompanied by sparking at the
brushes. If a shunt dynamo, insert an ammeter into the shunt circuit,
and note if the deflection be steady. If this be not the case, the variation
in the current most probably proceeds from imperfect contacts thrown
into vibration.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Ques. How is the insulation affected by moisture?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. Moisture tends to decrease the insulation resistance,
thus in effect producing a short circuit with its attendant heating.
</p>
<p><b>Ques. How is moisture in the field coils detected?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. It is easily detected by applying the hand to the coils,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_662">[662]</a></span>
when they will be found to be damp, and in addition steam or
vapor will be given off where the machine is working.
</p>
<p>The fault may be remedied by drying and varnishing the coils.
</p>
<p><b>Ques. What is the indication of short circuits in the
field coils?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. This fault is characterized by an unequal heating of the
field coils. If the coils be connected in series, the faulty coil will
be heated to a less extent than the perfect coils; if connected in
parallel, the faulty coil will be heated to a greater extent than the
perfect coils. The former can thus be easily located.

OPERATION OF MOTORS
</h2>
<p>In operating motors of any considerable size, whether connected
to the public supply mains of a central generating station
for combined lighting and power service, or to power service
mains only, there are certain precautions to be observed in
starting, stopping, and regulating the motor, in order that the
efficiency of the supply, and indirectly the working of other
motors and lamps connected to the mains in the immediate
neighborhood, may not be affected by abnormal variations of
pressure. These precautions should be observed also to prevent
any danger of the motor itself being subjected to detrimental
mechanical shocks and excessive temperatures in the working
parts.
</p>
<p><b>Before Starting a Motor.</b>--The general instructions relating
to inspection and adjustment, lubrication, etc., which have
already been given, should be carefully followed preparatory
to starting<a id="FNanchor_E"></a><a href="#Footnote_E" class="fnanchor"><sup>E</sup></a>.
</p>
<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_E"></a><a href="#FNanchor_E"><span class="fnlabel">[E]</span></a>

NOTE.--In starting a motor, first see that the bearings contain sufficient oil and that the
brushes bear evenly on the commutator. If a circuit breaker be used, close it; then close the
main switch. Rotate slowly the handle of the starting rheostat as far as it will go. Care
should be taken, in starting the motor, that the handle of the rheostat be not rotated too fast.
To stop a motor, open the circuit breaker or switch, which will cut in the resistance of the
starting box. Never attempt to stop a motor by forcibly pulling open the starting box,
<i>Disregard of these instructions may cause burning out of the field coils.</i>
</p>
</div>
<p><b>Starting a Motor.</b>--In starting a motor, resistance must be
put in series with the armature because, since there is no reverse
electromotive force to counteract the applied voltage when the
motor is at rest, the switching of the latter direct to the motor
would result in an abnormal rush of current. This, in addition
to being uneconomical and productive of a drop of voltage in

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_664">[664]</a></span>
the mains, would injure all except the smallest motors. Hence
motors above two horse power usually require a rheostat.
</p>
<p><b>Ques. Describe a rheostat or "starting box."</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. It consists essentially of a suitable resistance to be
inserted at starting to reduce the initial rush of current, and
which can be cut out in sections by successive movements of a
lever as the speed increases.
</p>
<div class="image">

<p class="caption"><a id="Fig_731"></a><span class="smcap">Fig</span>. 731.--Press for forcing on and removing a commutator. Small commutators are pressed
on to the shaft by a hand press. All of the larger commutators are pressed on by means
of a power press. In the above figure is shown a hand press. The plate <i>B</i> is used in
removing old commutators. It is placed back of the commutator as at <i>x y</i> with the slot
<i>C</i> over the shaft. Bolts <i>a b</i> are passed through the holes in the plate and secured by
nuts. The commutator can then be forced off the shaft. In pressing on a commutator, a
sleeve is placed over the shaft at <i>O</i>, and against the commutator. The rear end of the
shaft is secured so it will withstand the pressure, and the commutator is forced on. The
power presses are built on the principle of a hydraulic press. In pressing on a commutator
a piece of babbitt metal or soft brass should be used against the end of the shaft.
The shaft should be painted with white lead before having the commutator pressed on,
in order to lubricate the shaft so that the commutator will press on easily. The wiper
rings are pressed on after the commutator and then the armature is ready to be connected.
</p>
</div>
<p><b>Ques. Describe what occurs in starting a motor.</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. When the lever of the starting box is moved to the first
contact some of the resistance is cut out of the circuit and current
flows through the motor. This produces a torque and starts the
armature rotating. The movement of the armature induces a
reverse voltage, which, as the speed increases, gradually reduces

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_665">[665]</a></span>
the applied current. With this reduction of current, the torque
is reduced and the speed not accelerated as quickly as at first.
When the applied current has been reduced to a certain value by
the increasing reverse current, the handle of the starting box is
moved to the next contact, and so on till all the resistance in the
starting box has been cut out, the motor then attaining its normal
speed.

rheostats of small size consists usually of tinned iron wire wound on asbestos tubes, as
shown in <a href="#Fig_732">fig. 732</a>, the tubes being firmly supported by porcelain nipples, the ends of which
fit into holes in the top and bottom of the enclosing case. In starters of larger size, cast
metal grids, as shown in <a href="#Fig_733">fig. 733</a>, are used. In addition to these types of resistance, some
forms of starter are equipped with what is known as "unit" type resistance. In this
form, the resistance is built up of a number of separate sections, or units, which are connected
to form the complete starting or regulating resistance as the case may be. A single
unit consists of a moulded core of vitreous material upon which is wound the resistance
wire, as shown in <a href="#Fig_734">fig. 734</a>. The surface of the unit is then coated with a special cement and
baked. By this method the resistance material is protected from mechanical injury and
is also made proof against moisture and other conditions which sometimes affect the
ordinary type of resistance. In addition to units coated with cement only, there are still
other types of units, as in <a href="#Fig_735">fig. 735</a>, which are provided with a sheet metal covering around
the cement, as a further precaution against injury. Each of the various types of resistance
described possesses certain characteristics not shared by the others, the use of any
particular type being largely governed by conditions of service.

</p>
<p>Ans. Motor starting rheostats or "starting boxes," are

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_666">[666]</a></span>
designed to start a motor and bring it gradually from rest to full
speed. They are <i>not</i> intended to regulate the speed and must not
be used for such purpose.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Failure to observe this caution will result in burning out the resistance
which, in a motor starter, is sufficient to carry the current for a limited
time only</i>, whereas in the case of speed regulators sufficient resistance is
provided to carry the full load current continuously.

</div>
<p><b>Ques. For what kinds of service are speed regulators
used?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. In cases when the speed must be varied, as in traction
motors, organ blowers, machine tool drive, etc.
</p>
<p><b>Ques. How long does it take to start a motor?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. Usually from five to ten seconds.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_667">[667]</a></span>
<b>Ques. How is the starting lever operated?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. It is moved progressively from contact to contact,
pausing long enough on each contact for the motor to accelerate
its speed before passing to the next.
</p>
<p><b>Ques. What are the conditions at starting in a series
motor?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. There is a rush of current, the magnitude of which
depends on the amount of resistance cut out at each movement
of the starting lever.

starter with renewable contacts. Motor starters in which the successive steps of resistance
are cut out by a pivoted lever carrying a contact shoe which slides over button contacts
or over contact segments, are known as sliding contact starters. Button contacts are
usually furnished with motor starting rheostats of small size while contact segments are
used on those of greater capacity. The contact segment being held in position by two
screws, is readily renewable when worn by long service or damaged by arcing. The fixed
button contact is not so easily renewed but being used only on small size starters is never
likely to be subjected to severe service. Some starters, however, have renewable button
contacts.
</p>
</div>
<p><b>Ques. How are small series motors started on battery
circuits?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. By simply closing a switch to complete the circuit, the
resistance of the battery being sufficient to prevent a great rush
of current while starting.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_668">[668]</a></span>
<b>Ques. How is a shunt motor started?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. In starting a shunt motor, no trouble is likely to occur
in connecting the field coils to the circuit. Since the resistance
of the armature is very low, it is necessary on constant voltage
circuits to use a starting rheostat in series with the armature.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The necessary connections are shown in <a href="#Fig_756">fig. 756</a>. The switch is first
closed thus sending current through the field coils, before any passes
through the armature. The rheostat lever P is then moved to the first
contact to allow a moderate amount of current to pass through the
armature. The resistance of the rheostat is gradually cut out by further
movement of the lever P, thus bringing the motor up to speed.

starter is designed to overcome the arcing on sliding contacts which, in the case of large
motors would be very severe. The cutting out of each step of resistance is accomplished
in the multiple switch starter by a separate carbon contact switch which breaks the circuit
with a quick snappy action.
</p>
</div>
<p><b>Ques. How does the reverse voltage affect the starting
of a motor?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. When a motor is standing still, there is no reverse
voltage, and the current taken at first is governed principally
by the resistance of the circuit. If the motor be series wound,
there is a momentary reverse voltage, due to self-induction while

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_669">[669]</a></span>
the field is building up. If the motor be shunt wound, self-induction
delays the current through the field coils, but that
through the armature is not impeded by such cause. When the
armature begins to revolve, reverse voltage is developed which
increases with the speed. The resistance of the starting box
may be gradually cut out as the armature comes to speed. Thus
the reverse voltage gradually replaces ohmic drop in limiting the
current as the motor comes to speed.

the release is adjusted.

<p class="caption"><a id="Fig_742"></a><span class="smcap">Fig</span>. 742.--Compound starter. Rheostats designed for the double duty of starting a motor

<p><b>Failure to Start.</b>--This fault, which is liable to occur in a
motor of any description, is similar to failure to excite in a dynamo,
and is liable to be produced by any of the causes mentioned
in connection with the latter fault, excluding insufficient speed,
and insufficient residual magnetism.
</p>
<p>When a motor fails to start, it should first be ascertained
if a supply of electrical energy be available in the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_670">[670]</a></span>
mains. This may readily be discovered by means of a voltmeter,
or if low tension service, by means of the fingers bridging across
the main terminals. If the supply of energy be present, the
contact arm of the starter should be moved into such position
that all resistance is inserted into circuit with the motor. This is
important, as the motor may start suddenly while trying to
ascertain the cause of the stoppage.

</div>
<p>Having closed the switch, if the motor fail to start, it will be
advisable to remove the load if possible, as the failure may arise
from an overload of the machine. This being effected and the

by the means already described for voltage. If no voltage be

for in the main fuse, switch, or starting box. The resistance
coils of the latter, through the heat developed, frequently break
in positions out of sight. If a defective contact of this nature
cannot readily be seen, the contact arm should be moved slowly
over the contacts, as it is possible the broken coil may be cut out
of circuit by this means.

be set to break the circuit on any overload not exceeding 50 per cent. of the rated capacity
of the motor. This calibrated scale can also be used for determining, with a fair degree of
accuracy, the amount of current being consumed by the motor.
</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>If a difference of pressure exist between the motor terminals, the field
magnets will, if shunt or compound wound and in good order, be excited,
which may be ascertained by means of a bar of iron. If no magnetism
be present, it will of course, indicate a broken or bad connection, either
between the terminals of the field coils, or one or more of the coils themselves.
If the bar pull strongly, the position of the brushes upon the
commutator in regard to the neutral points should be ascertained, and
the rocker adjusted, if necessary, to bring them into their correct positions.
If this fail to start the motor, the connecting leads from the motor
terminals to the brushes and the brushes themselves should be carefully
examined for broken or bad connections, and defective contact of the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_672">[672]</a></span>
brushes with the commutator. In the latter case, it may arise from a
dirty state of the commutator, or from the brushes not being fed properly.
If due to these causes, pressing the brushes down upon the commutator
with the fingers will probably start the motor. If the failure to start
arise from none of these causes, it is probably due to the field coils
acting in opposition, or to a short circuited armature. This latter
remark applies more especially to motors provided with drum armatures.

<p class="caption"><a id="Fig_748"></a><span class="smcap">Fig</span>. 748.--Allen-Bradley type Z automatic motor starter. The operation of this machine is
as follows: When the main switch is closed, the motor circuit is made through the fuses,
resistance unit, current relay, and the motor armature. At the same time, the solenoid
circuit is closed (this is connected directly across the line, and takes a current which
is a small fraction of an ampere), and the plunger of the solenoid is drawn up, which
produces a pressure on the resistance unit, and increases the current in the motor circuit
to the predetermined value at which the current relay is set. When this value is reached
the current relay operates and opens the solenoid circuit, which reduces the magnetic pull
and allows the solenoid plunger to drop back slightly. This action increases the resistance
in the motor circuit, which decreases the current sufficiently to allow the relay to close
again. Similar cycles of operation are repeated as the motor accelerates, and each time
the plunger is drawn a little farther into the solenoid, until the short circuiting contacts on
the top are pushed together, which short circuits the current relay and resistance unit,
making them inoperative, and completing the operation of starting the motor. It will
be noted that in starting a motor with this device the current is always held down to a
certain predetermined value, and it is impossible to overload the motor by too rapid
starting. The current relay is calibrated in amperes, and may be set to suit existing
conditions. The action of the starter being controlled by a current relay and not by an
oil or air dash pot, the motor will start rapidly when under a light load, and slowly when
more heavily loaded. The fuses or circuit breakers may be set at a value that will furnish
protection to the motor under running conditions.

<p><b>Ques. What provision is made so that the magnetizing
current will have time to reach its normal value?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. The field connections are generally separated from the
actual starter, and taken to the main switch, so that wherever
the main switch is closed, the current flows through the field
coils, before the starting lever is moved.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_675">[675]</a></span>
<b>Ques. How are the connections arranged to avoid
excessive voltage in the windings due to self-induction?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. Generally the armature and field magnet circuits are
placed in a closed circuit that is never opened.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In other cases, in order that the rise of voltage may not injure the
insulation when the shunt is opened, a special form of main switch is
sometimes used which, before breaking from the supply, puts a non-inductive
resistance across the shunt of the motor. This is known as a
<i>flashing resistance</i>.

starter limits or by the setting of the rheostat arm. The stop button projects some distance
beyond any other portion of the device, in order that in case of emergency the
operator may stop the machine merely by hitting the face of the switch with his open
hand. The lever control switch, <a href="#Fig_753">fig. 753</a>, is similar in its action to the push button switch
but combines two other features: locking point, and visual indication of the station from
whence the press has been stopped. With the lever at the downward position, the press
is locked and cannot be started from any other station. In order to make the press ready
to start the lever must be raised to the central position. Thus a man may safely enter
the press without delay by setting his station to the locked position, knowing that it
cannot be started except by some one coming to that station and realizing that the press
has been purposely locked. Also, by looking along the press, it is possible to tell from
which station it has been locked, and proper action can be immediately taken. The safety
control station is usually combined for use on large rotary presses with the "slow" and
"fast" push buttons as shown in <a href="#Fig_752">fig. 752</a>. A pressure upon the fast or slow buttons will
cause the press speed to be correspondingly accelerated or retarded, and this action will
continue so long as the button is pressed. The press continues to run at the speed
attained at the instant of releasing the button. Any speed may, therefore, be selected or
changed to suit momentary requirements. This gives complete control excepting reversal
which is not required of such a press.

<p class="caption"><a id="Fig_754"></a><span class="smcap">Fig</span>. 754.--Wiring diagram of the standard form of Monitor controller. A set of solenoids are
connected in series and so interoperating as to cut resistance out of the armature circuit of
the motor as the apparatus it is driving comes up to speed. The controller is designed to
be used on all classes of work. In its simplest form, a single copper and graphite contact,
is controlled by two magnets, so proportioned as to cut out the entire starting resistance
when the armature current falls to a predetermined value. In the larger sizes, the number
of steps controlling the resistance is increased and arranged to produce the correct acceleration.
In every case the regulation of the starting resistance is effected entirely by the
current passing to the motor without the use of dash pot, mechanical governor or delicate
cut outs. The time element is thus directly proportioned to the load and the motor brought
up to speed in the shortest time consistent with the load, but always with safe limitation
of the armature current. The distinction between the current controlled starter and the
starter with dash pot governor should be noted. The starter here shown limits the starting
current to a fixed value throughout the starting operation, which is an ideal condition
and prevents blowing fuses in starting.

<b>Ques. How can shunt motors be controlled from a
distant point?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. The starter and switch are placed at the desired point
and the two main wires and the field wires run from that point
to the motor.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This requires additional wire which increases the cost and line loss.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Regulation of Motor Speed.</b>--Motors are generally run on
constant voltage circuits. Under these conditions, the speed
of series motors varies with the load and at light loads becomes
excessive. Shunt motors run at nearly constant speeds.
</p>
<p>For many purposes, particularly for traction, and for driving
tools, it is desirable to have speed regulation, so that motors
running on constant voltage circuits may be made to run at
different speeds.
</p>
<p>The following two methods are generally used for regulating
the speed of motors operated on constant voltage circuits:
</p>
<p>1. By inserting resistance in the armature circuit of a shunt
wound motor;
</p>
<p>2. By varying the field strength of series motors by switching
sections of the field coils in or out of circuit.
</p>
<p><b>Ques. Describe the first method.</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. This method is illustrated in <a href="#Fig_756">fig. 756</a>. When the main
switch is closed, the field becomes excited, then by moving the
lever P of the starting rheostat the various contacts (1, 2, 3, 4, 5),
more or less of the rheostat resistance is cut out of the armature
circuit, thus varying the speed correspondingly.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the same as the method of starting a motor, that is, <i>by variation
of resistance in armature circuit</i>, but it should be noted that when this
method is used for speed regulation, <i>a speed regulating rheostat should
be used instead of the ordinary starting box</i>, because the latter, not being
designed for the purpose, <i>will overheat and probably burn out</i>.

features required in the operation of large rotary presses, such as those used for printing
newspapers. From any one of various stations similar to the one illustrated in <a href="#Fig_753">fig. 753</a>,
located at all desirable places about the press, the latter may be started, stopped, accelerated,
slowed down or locked. It differs from other types of printing press controller in
that the solenoid has an overall maximum pull of less than one inch and does not actuate
the main line current directly but through pilot circuits, which in turn, operate flapper
switches; there are no sliding contacts. At the control stations, the operator can distinguish
the accelerating button from the retarding button by the sense of touch and obviously
he can in the same manner ascertain the position of the lever. The position of the
lever whether at start, stop or safety, can be readily observed at a distance. When the
lever of either control station is placed at stop, the current is disconnected from the motor
and a powerful dynamic brake brings the press to rest without delay and without shock
or harmful strain. The start will always be made with all resistance in the armature
circuit, and with full field, and should the current supply fail, the controller will release
and open the circuit to the motor. This controller will give a speed range as low as 10%
of normal speed by armature resistance and, by field control, any increase within the
speed of the motor.
</p>
</div>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_679">[679]</a></span>
<b>Ques. Describe the second method.</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. This method of regulating the speed of a series motor
is shown in <a href="#Fig_757">fig. 757</a>. The current through the armature will
flow through all the field windings when the position of the switch
lever S, is on contact 4, and the strength of the field will be the
maximum. By moving the arm to contact 3, 2, etc., sections of
the field winding are cut out, thus reducing the strength of field
and varying the speed.

</p>
</div>
<p><b>Ques. How does the speed vary with respect to variation
of field strength?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. Decreasing the field strength of a motor increases its
speed, while increasing the field strength decreases the speed.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Under the conditions of maximum field strength, as with switch S on
point 1, the torque will be greatest for any given current strength and
the reverse voltage also greatest at any given speed. The current through
the armature of the motor, to perform any given work, will thus be a
minimum, as well as the speed at which the motor has to run, in order to
develop sufficient reverse voltage to permit this current to flow. Regulation
of speed by varying the field strength is limited in range of action,
since the field saturation point is soon reached, moreover, with too low
a field strength, armature reaction produces excessive field distortion,
sparking, etc.

<p><b>Ques. How is the speed of shunt and compound
motors varied with respect to the normal speed in the two
methods?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. The first method (variable resistance in armature
circuit) reduces the speed <i>below</i> the normal or rated speed of the
machine, while the second method increases the speed <i>above</i> the
normal.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the first method the amount of speed reduction depends partly
upon the amount of resistance introduced into the armature circuit, and
partly upon the load.
</p>
<p>In the second method the amount of speed increase depends entirely
upon the amount of resistance placed in the shunt winding circuit.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_682">[682]</a></span>
Eighty-five per cent. is about the maximum speed reduction
obtainable by armature resistance but so great a reduction is
seldom satisfactory since comparatively slight increases in the
load will cause the motor to stall.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shunt field regulation may be obtained up to any point for which the
motor is suited, the only limitation in this case being the maximum
speed at which the motor may be safely operated.
</p>
<p>It should be remembered, however, that speed increase by shunt
field weakening increases the current in proportion to the increase in
speed, and care should be taken not to overload the armature.
</p>
<p>NOTE.--A compound motor may be made to run at constant speed, if the current in
the series winding of the field be arranged to act in opposition to that of the shunt winding.
In such case, an increase of load will weaken the fields and allow more current to flow through
the armature without decreasing the speed of the armature, as would be necessary in a shunt
motor. Such motors, however, are not very often used, since an overload would weaken the
fields too much and cause trouble. If the current in the series field act in the same direction
as that in the shunt fields, the motor will slow up some when a heavy load comes on, but will
take care of the load without much trouble.
</p>
<p>NOTE.--Motors have much the same faults as dynamos, but they make themselves
manifest in a different way. An open field circuit will prevent the motor starting, and will
cause the melting of fuses or burning out of the armature. A short circuit in the fields, if
it cut out only a part of the winding, will cause the motor to run faster and very likely spark
badly. If the brushes be not set exactly opposite each other, there will also be bad sparking.
If they be not at the neutral point, the motor will spark badly. Brushes should always be set
at the point of least sparking. If it become necessary to open the field circuit, it should be
done slowly, letting the arc gradually die out. A quick break of a circuit in connection with
any dynamo, or motor is not advisable, as it is very likely to break down the insulation of the
machine. The ordinary starting box for motors is wound with comparatively fine wire and
will get very hot if left in circuit long. The movement of the arm from the first to the last
point should not occupy more than thirty seconds and if the armature do not begin to move
at the first point, the arm should be thrown back and the trouble located.

with the lever on the left. The last switch (the one on right hand side) is held by an electro-magnet

latching device on the switch next to it. In front of each switch is placed a metal stop, so
arranged as to prevent any switch being operated until the one next to it on the left has
been closed. These metal stops constitute the interlocking mechanism and prevent the
starting of the motor in any way except by closing the switches in regular rotation, thus
insuring proper resistance in the circuit and protecting the motor from excessive starting
currents. When the current is interrupted, the electro-magnet releases the last switch,
which, on opening, releases the latch on the switch next to it, allowing that switch to open,
and this in turn releases the next latch and so on, the switches opening automatically one
after another. In starting the motor, each switch should be closed quickly and firmly,
pausing a second or two before closing the next switch to give the motor time to accelerate.

No provision is made in regulators of this type for increasing the speed of the motor.
The maximum speed obtainable when these regulators are used is, therefore, the normal
speed at which the motor is designed to operate with no resistance in circuit. With all
resistance in circuit and the motor taking normal current these regulators will reduce the
speed of the motor 50 per cent. If the motor be taking less than normal current the percentage
of speed reduction obtainable will be correspondingly less. The notched fan tail

the lever squarely on any contact so long as the no voltage release magnet is energized.
</p>
</div>
<p><b>Ques. How is a wide range of speed regulation secured?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. By a combination of the two methods.
</p>
<p><b>Regulation by Armature Resistance.</b>--Speed regulators
for this method of regulation, are designed to carry the normal
current on any contact without overheating and when all the
resistance is in the circuit, they will reduce the speed of the motor
about 50 per cent. provided the motor be taking the normal
current. When operating without resistance in the armature
circuit, shunt wound and compound wound motors will regulate
to approximately constant speed regardless of load. This
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_684">[684]</a></span>
characteristic of inherent regulation is lost, however, when
armature resistance is employed to reduce the speed of the motor,
fluctuations in load resulting in fluctuations in speed, which
become more noticeable as the amount of resistance inserted
in the armature circuit is increased. Accordingly, it becomes
necessary to move the lever of the speed regulator forward or
backward to again obtain the speed at which the machine was
operating before the load changed.

<p class="caption"><a id="Fig_761"></a><span class="smcap">Fig</span>. 761.--Cutler-Hammer compound starter with no voltage and overload release. This is
a starting rheostat and field regulator combined. In operation, two levers are employed,
both being mounted on the same hub post and one lying directly under the other. The
upper lever only is provided with a handle, but when moving from the off position to the
starting position (that is to say, from left to right) the lower, or starting, lever is carried
along by the upper, or speed regulating, lever until it comes in contact with the no voltage
release magnet where it is held fast by the attraction of the magnet, leaving the upper
lever free to be moved backward over the field contacts, thus weakening the shunt field of
the motor little by little until the desired speed is attained. During the operation of starting
the motor, the field resistance is short circuited by an auxiliary contact (the slotted
metal strip shown near center of rheostat) but as soon as the starting lever touches the no
voltage release magnet or, in other words, when the motor has been accelerated to normal
speed, this short circuit is removed, and the field resistance becomes effective for speed
regulation. The motor is accelerated from rest to normal speed by moving both levers
from left to right, while increases in speed above normal are obtained by moving the upper
lever from right to left. Only the lower, or starting lever comes into contact with the
no voltage release magnet. This lever is provided with a strong spiral spring which tends
always to throw the lever back to the off position. Hence should the voltage fail, the no
voltage release magnet releases the starting lever and this, in flying back to the off position,
opens the armature circuit of the motor and carries the speed regulating lever with it to
the off position. The upper, or speed regulating lever, not being influenced by the spring,
though mounted on the same hub post as the starting lever, may be moved back and forth
at will or left indefinitely in the position which gives the speed desired.

</div>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_685">[685]</a></span>
When the speed of a motor driving a constant torque machine is
reduced by inserting resistance in the armature circuit there is no
corresponding reduction in current consumed. The motor runs more
slowly simply because a part of the energy impelling it is shunted into
the resistance and there dissipated in the form of heat. Hence, whether
the motor be operating at full speed or half speed, the amount of current
consumed is the same; the only difference being that in the one case
all the energy taken from the line is expended in driving the motor while
in the other case only one half is utilized for power, the other half being
dissipated in the resistance. Speed regulation by armature resistance
only is therefore open to two objections: 1, the difficulty of maintaining
constant speed under varying load conditions, and 2, the necessity of
wasting energy to secure speed reduction. These objections are, in part,
offset by the fact that speed reduction by armature resistance may be
applied to any motor of standard design and requires nothing more than
the simplest and least expensive speed regulating rheostat.
</p>
<p>In cases where the motor will be operated nearly always at full speed,
the difference in first cost of the installation may justify the use of the
armature resistance method of control. As a rule, speed regulation by
shunt field resistance is preferable.

motions on lathes, planers and other machine tools which may rotate in either direction

but merely to start it and bring it smoothly up to full speed in either direction. Two no

of voltage a strong centering spring attached to the hub-post of the lever throws the latter

</p>
</div>
<p>The weakening of the shunt field of a motor by the insertion
of resistance in the shunt field circuit causes the armature to
revolve more rapidly. One advantage of this method of control
is that the motor will inherently regulate to approximately constant
speed under widely varying load conditions. Another
advantage is found in the fact that all of the current taken from
the line is utilized for power, the changes in speed being obtained
not by dissipating a portion of the effective energy in the resistance
(as in the case of the armature resistance method of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_690">[690]</a></span>
control) but by weakening the reverse voltage by inserting
resistance in the shunt field circuit. Speed increase by shunt field
weakening is limited, however, to about 10 to 15 per cent. above
the normal speed in motors of standard construction. Greater
ranges of speed can be obtained from motors especially designed
for shunt field control but should not be attempted with motors
of standard design without first ascertaining from the manufacturer
the maximum safe speed.
</p>
<p><b>Combined Armature and Shunt Field Control.</b>--Regulation
by combined armature and shunt field resistance is by far
the easiest way of obtaining a wide range of speeds. Rheostats
embodying these methods are known as <i>compound speed regulators</i>,
one form being shown in <a href="#Fig_762">fig. 762</a>. Standard regulators
can be obtained giving a wide range of speed variation, and
special regulators may be constructed giving practically any
desired range.
</p>
<p><b>Selection of Starters and Regulators.</b>--Unsatisfactory
operation of these devices is, in nearly all cases, due to lack of
precaution in selecting the proper piece of apparatus for the work
to be done. One of the commonest errors is to select a rheostat
of insufficient capacity. If the current required to operate the
motor at full speed with no resistance in circuit be greater than
the rated capacity of the rheostat, overheating of the resistance
will result. An increase in temperature even to a point where
the hand cannot be held on the enclosing case need cause no
apprehension, but should the resistance become red hot it
indicates that the apparatus is being worked far beyond its
capacity, and the load on the motor should be reduced or a
regulator of greater capacity substituted.

<p>If the current required to operate the motor at full speed with
no resistance in circuit be less than the rated capacity of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_691">[691]</a></span>

A cord running from the top of the organ bellows passes over two pulleys and is then made
fast to the chain furnished with the regulator. This chain passes around a sheave which
turns on a post projecting from the center of the slate panel. Attached to the lower end
of the chain is a weight, also furnished with the regulator. As the air is exhausted from
the bellows the latter slowly collapses, drawing the rope down with it, and in so doing
turns the sheave from left to right, thus cutting resistance out of circuit and increasing
the speed of the motor which pumps air into the bellows. Responding to the inrush of
air, the bellows expands, relaxing the tension on the rope which is now pulled in the opposite
direction by the weight, thus turning the sheave from right to left, cutting resistance
into circuit once more and slowing down the motor. The speed of the motor is thus
automatically regulated by the bellows, with the result that a practically uniform pressure
is maintained at all times. In connection with an organ blower regulator it is necessary
to install a separate starting rheostat. This is required for the reason that all organ
bellows leak. During the intermissions in the musical part of the service, or at other
times when the blower is not operating, the air gradually escapes and the bellows settles
down, moving the rheostat arm to the right and cutting out resistance. With the motor
at rest and the bellows empty all the blower regulator resistance would be short circuited
and it is therefore necessary to avoid throwing the motor directly across the line when
starting again. A starting rheostat with no voltage release is suitable for this purpose,
and should be installed within easy reach of the organist, so that a moment or two
before beginning to play he can move the lever of the starting box and get the motor
into operation. Where remote control is desirable a self starter can be substituted for
the manually operated starting box, in which case the entire installation can be controlled
by a push button, or single throw knife switch.

mechanism consists of a long spindle, carrying a number of heavy brass or gun metal
segments, making contact for a longer or shorter time with a corresponding number of
spring contacts. The spindle is provided at its upper end with a handle, and the various
contacts are made by turning it through an arc of about 150°. For this method a moderate
amount of resistance is employed. The first contact joins both motors and the full amount
of resistance in series across the line, and as the motors are standing still, maximum current
flows so that they exert their full torque. The moment they start to revolve, the current
tends to fall, due to the generation of a reverse voltage; to prevent this and maintain a
heavy current for some time, thus obtaining rapid acceleration, the resistance is arranged
so that it can be gradually reduced, until at about the fourth notch the two motors are in
series without resistance across the line. To increase still further the speed in the above
type of controller, the series fields may be shunted, and then the next steps place the motors
in parallel with the resistance.

<p>Magnetic blow out coils are used on all controllers designed for 500
volt circuits, and on types designed for lower voltages requiring more
than 60 amperes normal capacity.
</p>
<p>The coils are wound with either copper wire or flat strips of sufficient
capacity to carry full load current continuously without undue heating,
and after being wound they are treated with an insulating compound
making them moisture proof.

<b>Ques. What provision is made to prevent reversal
before bringing the controller lever to the "off" position?</b>
</p>
<p>Ans. Controllers having separate reversing cylinders are
fitted with mechanical interlocks making it necessary to place
lever in off position before reversing.

<p><b>Two Motor Regulation.</b>--With a two motor equipment,
the controller becomes more complicated because it must be
arranged to switch the motors in series or in parallel, so as to
secure economy at half and full speed. The various connections
of series-parallel regulation are shown in figs. <a href='#Fig_772_782'>772 to 782</a>.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_696">[696]</a></span>
From these diagrams it is seen that the motors are first operated in
series until all the resistance is cut out by the controller (figs. <a href='#Fig_772_782'>772 to 777</a>).
</p>
<p>The next point on the controller puts the two motors in parallel with
some resistance in the circuit (<a href='#Fig_772_782'>fig. 778</a>), which resistance is gradually short
circuited on the remaining controller points, until at full speed all the
resistance is cut out, the two motors remaining in parallel (figs. <a href='#Fig_772_782'>778 to 782</a>).
</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Stopping a Motor.</b>--If it be desired to stop a motor, the
main switch is opened. As the armature of the motor continues
to operate, due to its inertia, it generates an electromotive
force which sends a current through the shunt
connected field circuit and helps to maintain the field excitation.
When the speed of the motor has decreased sufficiently so as not
to endanger the motor should the main switch be thrown, the
current in the series magnet becomes weakened, and the spring
throws back the starting box arm.
</p>
<p>It should be noted that in stopping a motor having a starting
box provided with a no voltage release simply open the
main switch and do not touch the lever because otherwise, the
self induced voltage of the field circuit may puncture the field
winding or the insulation of the adjoining wires in the starting box.
